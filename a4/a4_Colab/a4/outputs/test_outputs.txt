You know what I do is I write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> as farmer, or <unk> clothes and never had a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is generally something that fell into the place.
You just have to turn the apple back to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle which I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the 1970s on the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went back to bleeding every week in the bathroom bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life when I was able to go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I was doing it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California, I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call.
I'm <unk> that of adults never came to us.
You could call it <unk> and please bring that man to know that you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> pancreatic cancer, and I'd like to tell you that I have to do this for please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
And we found it a place, the <unk> and take care of her family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult <unk> became a <unk> and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed -- he had turned into a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about was present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her from it.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today was very happy today about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them around the <unk> of the water almost 60 feet, and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> one year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall out of glaciers or they break down the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to <unk> and they hold up to the end, while others can't get more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and themselves, largely like we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts, I am breathing its atmosphere <unk>
As a <unk> melts, it releases sweet water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way, and they will not have to exist again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way through the cycle of life.
Part of the <unk> ice that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice is over 100 thousand years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually be able to witness a <unk> iceberg to see.
Here you have.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like to pay attention to the form of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg in the average size.
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two partners in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single baby, OK.
So, two couples with a baby.
I don't want you to feel too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about conception of themselves, I'm not going to pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the sperm chromosome joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
And both <unk> and the life starts.
We're going to talk about them later.
In my activity that's going to be two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- and to say, of human bodies, and <unk> how they've considered the body fluids.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> twins two people inside one body.
I've worked with <unk> people much lower than the average average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical blocks doesn't fit into the male and male <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many ways.
I'm going to give you a few examples in ways to have a sex that doesn't exist in common or female forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which gene, of the chromosome from the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the life <unk> that we all have <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high testosterone levels but <unk>
As a consequence, the body is develops following a <unk> course.
When you turn out the baby is a little bit of a girl.
It's a girl. He's raised as a girl.
And often, it's not even until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the breast and it doesn't have the menstrual cycle, when someone realizes that something is happening.
And after doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a chromosome out there.
The important thing to understand is that you can think about a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women like men, we have the body of something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a woman who has no known <unk> <unk> and I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> than the woman who was born with testicles that have <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing -- it's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 boy born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relations with her, he was wearing a life as a boy and he had just found that he had <unk> and I was a <unk>
He had a extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had the 20th wells and the uterus -- the <unk> <unk> were so active that, in essence, created a male hormonal environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component typically a male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical problems caused by internal <unk> when doctors found that, in fact, women was a woman.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th century develop what's known as <unk> -- they have tissue <unk> wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that is happening.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies are <unk> <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> to open-heart surgery. It's not to be able to have a better physical health as well.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason you get to several surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> identity.
A very simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very distinctive ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people in one same body.
The biggest recent case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put in the fabric of their sex in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called to wonder: "What test you are going to do to determine whether <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there isn't such a test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and <unk> are us who we mapped that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, we more need to admit that these categories -- we thought were a stable categories that would be used directly with <unk> categories -- they're much more <unk> than they were <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, something that turns out a lot more complicated than the <unk> terminology of the world.
As we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What did they find? They were in just a few <unk>
And as we go into the science we get more and more and more in a uncomfortable area that we need to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States of today, are the struggles at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which one body becomes human and it has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors had never got to join them with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved still not to <unk>
If you stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract life organs from a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with a prisoner's dilemma actually actually make death of anyone. And this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I get nervous.
And I think that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about it.
<unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I am a fervent <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find myself every single seeing that music, <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the Founding <unk>
<unk> <unk> were, for me, the first activists of anatomy and explain why.
What they did, it was a <unk> concept, and I repeated it with another one that was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we did, our Founding <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it became political power by the right of blood being passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
The Founding <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered to be the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was a very radical.
And they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were <unk>
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time -- the science <unk>
And so there is very clear, if you look at the story of the Founding <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be transmitted by a vague idea of the right of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence is talking about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And it was a result, the idea of <unk> <unk>
And when they did, they were <unk> the foundations of the future <unk> of human rights.
They didn't think about that way, but it was great.
And what happened next?
And women are <unk>
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Civil Rights and saying, "I'm a man."
And again, some of the color people that <unk> the <unk> coincidence of the difference -- again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we need to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we should be able to get to anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five-year-old were needed to have sex or <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they are keeping and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings in the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary was born three months earlier -- June 1, 1980.
Henry, in the contrary, born in term: September 1, 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months earlier that Mary has been attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right -- the right to the vote, the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because I have a different age, but because it was born.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, for virtue of being considered man, if I haven't told you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man -- is now <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of that that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, on their part, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories that in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now is that science has gone so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a rare position.
For example: Texas has decided to get married with a man -- you don't have to have a woman and to get married with a woman you have to have the <unk>
Now, in practice they don't do tests of people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you about the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people who are <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very <unk>
But in practice, how do you do?
How do people judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I would have to focus on this for human rights to people, because I have admit that I know some <unk> <unk> that they probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and smart decisions about their sexual sexual relationships that I know.
So how do you put the subject of content to <unk>
It's very difficult.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of one person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with <unk>
We want to really get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to keep this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian that a man who is attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless he is willing to meet a change of sex, in which case it allows you to live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done a few years ago that I had done to <unk> <unk> and then pick up their name.
But when the phone asked the operation to the operation was a very <unk> operation, he told me that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and so I had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum.
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are not <unk> to change the sake of the state.
So I think we need to be the head.
Well, to end up I want to say I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be like democracy, or as it might have been, if we had increased <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about the group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in looking at the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and to operate in the world.
And what we know from <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and dealing with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
A few years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism -- and I was considered <unk> as <unk> as a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what does women have <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to be able to do with rid of rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing women in the <unk>
But the more I think about your question, the more it has seemed to me that there is women in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to the complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So, if I were the youngsters very well to find the way to protect people from the state, it's possible that there are more likely to be more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we make democracy beyond the <unk> think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect, let's think of what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family to think about where they want to go live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents to <unk>
Well, at this point we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't tell a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth a lot more than the cost of construction.
So we could easily address the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just ran out of drilling buildings.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments already were owners, and that in the other half still lack of the way to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to do <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that are around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions of the construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, building a new apartment building, always and when the rules of that <unk> place instead of putting <unk>
So I proposed that governments have new reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of <unk> <unk>
They knew that every year around 75,000 <unk> they would come up from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and make those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> country by a constitutional crisis.
In the next <unk> elections -- <unk> <unk> they were charged with a platform in which we are growing reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, such as those rules that say they can't go and annoy all of the current residents in apartments.
It will make a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually are the rules that keep us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we came together in Miami, a conference room of a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> which in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it begins with <unk> <unk> a <unk> which would <unk> the rules that were going to be there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which included a picture like this, which was trying to explain to a whole city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
This airport is only over 100 kilometers square.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
All the world's <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have this in my <unk>
So I felt and showed the <unk>
And this explained to him that a new city can provide new options for people.
There would be a choice of a city that could be going to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And they also need new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help from <unk> countries, could benefit from the countries associated with them that they would help to establish and make the rules of <unk> so that they all could trust that <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
I could cover a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow these special brain regions.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis in Congress to favor of this constitutional constitutional crisis was <unk> to one.
All of these are <unk> every society in society, <unk>
In the <unk> it's got to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17th, passed over again on another voting -- <unk> to one.
And then after the voting voting to 24 of February, a <unk> shifting <unk> a <unk> shifting to the two places that are more interested in engaging in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center center of the city that is building in Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
All that you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years old, getting the <unk>
The other interest in building construction is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about it <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> and then it would be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow the Supreme Court to be the last last one for this new <unk> system.
There are urban urban planners and cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you've already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are many companies who wanted to be <unk> especially in a place with a free area, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change it immediately somewhere else.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave their family back to their family to get a job to get a job, sometimes they have to earn money for just to eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even there are children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it look like to think about insist that families can choose between many cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Because TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public confession and that is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and I would find a little bit more recently to photograph and publish in my blog and colorful suits for each time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second <unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to know people who are <unk> by the general way, my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
I would like color for?"
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel like I won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what we would call for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what is someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven pairs of clothing and nothing else.
<unk> on exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that I would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after coming here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman walking on your underwear,  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is what I call brilliant.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look right.
You almost always see a phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be bad -- when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you also <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're in.
Sometimes people tell me that it looks like the <unk> or I remember their little seven years.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you look at something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't look at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, you don't look at you that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you. The gold <unk> are going to do it.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, the one is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it again and again when people were approaching this week just because of what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, and I'm going to give everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave back certain things.
I don't need any emotionally passionate about these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and bright <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart, and I come up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts.
The left-hand side that is the <unk> and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be completely logical
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I believe that for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something -- with a big <unk> in both of them <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
And I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum <unk> <unk> we need a lot of logic on <unk> these complicated <unk>
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put it to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you can have developed with the step of the years that it says that one thing can be only in one place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and I didn't do it very well, it always was <unk>
But I bet the play with that parking bar, I showed him a valuable lesson, and it is that big things don't allow the <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a big model of conceptual model that you can have from the world, except that you are a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a physicist physicist because they don't play with parking lot, they play with these strange little particles.
And when they play their particles, they found that they make all kinds of things that are really rare -- as they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics of a few years, you need from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects that are around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and it may be because it's not very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I have never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object is also still the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in in the center.
And then here we do a good approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of a metal little bit of a springboard and a springboard with a springboard and <unk> <unk> on a platform.
And so I made this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip, and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this hole in a way of <unk> <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator I'm doing all sorts of rare things, but then when other people are going up to do those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or, actually, I want you to <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The colleagues of inanimate objects are not just people -- it is the light that <unk> and the wind that goes on to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and pulled it all over the air, and then they put it down to a temperature of less than a degree of <unk>
Now, when you're just going to be in the <unk> the little metal piece is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We found that they moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. and the way it <unk> was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And when you give it a soft thrust, we were able to make it <unk> and that doesn't happen at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you about is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those atoms are moving up to the top and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that each atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years. Because look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little metal piece is more or less the same as the difference between that little piece of metal and you.
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logical part that you talk about.
So imagine if you were in a number of places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you get your consciousness if your body is <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we did, and we turned the lights up and we looked at the box, we saw that the metal was still there on a single piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects in the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a little space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics will mean that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define you who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job in Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss, which is here and allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and so.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they were doing it with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories from why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining to this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education of education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and art work.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started to learn a lot.
And working on Google, trying to actually make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So let me better show that a demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done since their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery, <unk> <unk> <unk> Van <unk>
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorite and <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do that -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with a single click on it.
They're inside, you want to go at the end of the hall,
continue to go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I've never come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm clicking here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the technology <unk>
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression is not <unk>
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
And I came up and discovered that children were actually playing something.
So I was talking about a little bit of people in the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get deeper and even deeper and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the image, so you'll see really what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, one second.
So now we're going quickly to jump again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what happens if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see what van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It enhances it and it really does it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night. I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part of it. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can actually create your own museum, create your own collection of all these images.
It's very easy, we walk -- I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we've just done a zooming around.
This is <unk> in the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even comes from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium makes justice to your art work and that is represented online online.
And the big question that I'm doing today is, "You do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
So think it's a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am <unk> Italian <unk> all the children in Italy grow up with this picture in the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that something really interesting has happened in the racing careers in the last two decades.
So some time ago, if you wanted to win a career of Formula one, you take a budget, and you put it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the race.
This is what in engineering -- in engineering, the control system of control in real time.
This is basically a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
The interesting thing is that the real-time control systems are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're going to be becoming <unk> computers.
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for <unk> during the <unk>
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way, it is like almost all of the existing atoms get out of sensors and <unk>
And that is completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end he took the hammer and he threw it up to the Moses -- he did still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said he said, <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> on the idea of getting the environment and play something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end, <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day looking at <unk> activity in the network.
Here's the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
By the early afternoon, there are people here, and there are <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a call fast and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yeah!
That night they all went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day they all went to the center of the winner and the prime minister of the time.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how today you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and we use.
We know all about the shape of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how they get <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the garbage in their shift in the system.
We started with some volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little bit more than one year, to tag what they were doing, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that in all ways.
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage -- and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> it doesn't happen, it's still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we <unk> a day still still there.
If we show that to people, then we'll be able to promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning, which is actually hitting the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
Everything started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we develop at MIT, in a garage, was, imagine you have a <unk> and you give you a <unk> valves <unk>
It creates like a <unk> <unk> with pixels of water.
If you get the pixels to the pixels and you can write on them, I'll show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
It liked a lot.
And we had a commission to design the building of the <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no windows and no windows, but when you're approaching it just opens up for you to happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this.
Those days there will always be somebody, in the winter when the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it goes down almost all the architecture is gone.
This is running.
You see the <unk> people because of what's inside it.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was able to let you happen, but a building that kept doing <unk> and water holes and one had to jump out of <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels and the pixels of water, and of projections over them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine you could have small helicopters in the air and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw earlier, which moves with other <unk>
Could we form this cloud, we could form this cloud, you could form this cloud, you could form this cloud, this cloud, to form this cloud, this cloud, you can form this cloud, you can form this cloud, this cloud, we could form this cloud, you could form this cloud, this cloud, you can form this cloud, you can form this cloud, this cloud, to form this cloud, this cloud,
A flexible screen like this with a regular configuration in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, but in three dimensions, what it changes is light, not the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears at different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in which you can get closer and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancing dancers of today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use them as input to the <unk>
Here we can see her dancing.
On the left, you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> like motion capture.
It can be <unk> all the movement.
You can go through the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people in order to do something and change our <unk> environment as an oyster nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened over the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can go from the digital world of the power of identical power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think of climate change or CO2 emissions, how to go from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are red.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with this one.
You can move around with different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom, serve to share the major moments of the Olympics 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can rise, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you want to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, they could improve the <unk> by a more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure <unk>
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe be from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What are you most <unk>
What would you like if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How much people will do creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably had the number of creative creative people there.
That's very good.
How many of the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of them, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe be possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> topic here at the TED Conference but today I want to give you the eyes of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that in addition to <unk> <unk> <unk> wrote an essay entitled "No in biology makes sense of the light of <unk>
But you actually accept biological evolution, consider this: It's just the past, or the future?
It's about others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is, of course, the most interest of us.
We had a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here a few years old.
It might seem like we are far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not as human insulin -- but it's the same protein, which is the same possible protein, which comes out of the <unk>
And by talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the most bacteria that the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> does it on the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully active environment for those bacteria.
It's warm down, it's very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that they might want without a <unk> effort.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush rush to the way.
But by that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest <unk> nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something perhaps better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, life on the Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I was just <unk> I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, every cell simply divide and all the genetic energy from that cell is transmitted to the two Asian cells.
But when the organisms appear <unk> things start to change.
The sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to suggest that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death by <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas well in their 90s, in their late 90s, in their late years.
And one night someone hits her door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a slight light dancer of clothes.
He looks at him and he says, <unk> for a <unk> of <unk>
He said, "It says George, I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to be healthy.
I wanted to recover health in disease.
I wanted us to live more and more in a healthier way.
Evolution is going to move the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
And I think everybody else put the feeling that put Woody Allen when he said, "I want to get the immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily happen to longevity.
Not necessarily favors the biggest or the stronger or the more clever or even the smarter.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish in the vacuum, however, have been able to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if you go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look at the next phase -- I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying thinking would be that by medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we <unk> so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation of that evolution.
A second possibility is that there's a natural kind of evolution of traditional species, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would argue that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when the species <unk> distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural ways.
But there is a third possibility, an intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose to the individual and family level.
Think about whether it was possible to be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body <unk> <unk> to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their genes.
If we look at the future that kind of change is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of going on, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost of 20,000 dollars and about a week.
It doesn't have a lot to do so that the human genome is going to be <unk> and more and more to the end of all.
These are those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect them but they are going to induce <unk>
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against flu flu cells in a plant plant.
Can you imagine something good about the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just two little <unk>
They can change the cells from their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give their children a better chance of a healthy life, to remove the diabetes, eliminate the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want to be more <unk>
And then that same analytical technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of an Ken <unk> especially if you could get it to the next generation of the <unk> machine.
Why not have a <unk> muscle muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have turned the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100 thousand years and we can give it to a thousand years, and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or our grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these options in addition to a better society, more successful society, more successful society.
Or, we're going to be able to selectively pick up different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and <unk> the wisdom required to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or worse, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds frightening.
Well, I had a single seat -- I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight assistants here.
So I immediately looked at the look, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Generally, that's not the way.
The motors.
Imagine being on a plane and not <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three <unk> words I'd ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they died, and I thought about all the people that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the fences that I wanted to get to and I didn't, all the fences that I wanted to <unk> all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
While I was thinking about that, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to focus on anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as a <unk> the bridge George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, wow, wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and with my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also give up to my <unk>
And I'm sorry about the time that I think about things that didn't care about people that do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
Two years I've never had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have reason to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I came out, I had the feeling of, Wow, dying not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was on a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not much artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> as a little bit.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point, I understand those two points -- that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was awarded a miracle, not dying that day.
And he gave me another gift that was the possibility of looking at the future and go back and live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please be not like that, but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is it that <unk> you still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents that are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many <unk> projects.
But the most cool thing I worked on was this guy.
The guy called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important 1980s.
One day he came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has a complete <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation like that, obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the art of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're going to be an important person and have a very good insurance thing you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Somebody saw the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate with that way -- they are doing with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented to the only wish to deliver a check and instead of that signed up a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I sat up with his brother and her father right there at that very precise moment, "All right, this is what Tony is going to talk, and we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside your inner can't <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
And I met these guys called <unk> Research, Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project light on any surface and then with a laser pointer you draw on that and register the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They first start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the <unk> and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And a few years later, about a year later, about a year later, after a lot of organization -- and a lot of a way to move the things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of safe companies and we get a machine to <unk> it could make a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's about the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to the guy -- you get an email from it, and you say, "Don't <unk> this guy's <unk>
The other thing that we did was bring seven programmers around the whole corner of <unk> to our home.
My wife, kids and I, moved to the garage behind and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were <unk> they would have taken off the walls of the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went down to the journey of <unk> my son was part, my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
These are a pair of cheap sun that we bought in the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a <unk> camera, we put it on a light bulb and now there's a device that is free -- and you build yourself -- we published the code <unk> the software is low for free.
And we created a device that doesn't have a limitation at all.
There's no insurance company.
There are no hospital that can say, "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicating using your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the other person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And after a year of planning -- two weeks of teaching intense sessions from all night, Tony <unk> for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed for that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall from the hospital outside of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust into the parking lot as well as if we were <unk> graffiti as well.
And at the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was saying, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and they would take me out there so that I could get it out.
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it is the equivalent of a <unk> material.
Someone with this artistic potential is worth more.
So we're trying to figure out how to fix it, and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
<unk> were like, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong had something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the best 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up from close to the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> in the middle of Los Angeles is going to have an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, do you can.
None of what there's in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the <unk> -- nothing possible at the time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I have never done anything with <unk> technology -- I just recognized something, and I was obsessed with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you all to do every day when we find something that I feel like to do. If you are not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations usually very difficult and at the same time a dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> and dangerous <unk>
And I spent 30 days eating only a lot of fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I have been focusing on a lot of my career, with the only goal to try to examine social issues in ways that are going to be attractive, and hopefully analyzing it in a way that is <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I'd come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So, some of you can have heard, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered to sell rights from my TEDTalk from 2011.
What it was was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about and the content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridicule to you or your company to do it.
But they said this, it's a very good chance to do it.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you would have asked him a year ago, I would have no <unk>
But in the new film that I'm working on, we examined the world of marketing, <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've got myself in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could do anything that was so difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tries to try to try and <unk> the marketing and the advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie ever <unk> is that everything up at the bottom end of the end, has images of brand, all the time from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title of the title,
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in the film for <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> just <unk> It was more by <unk>
He was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the brand X brand, but we're going to make sure we're going to make sure we're going to make all the categories that we could on the film.
You might have a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe that you've ever met.
The most cool car that you've driven in "The greatest film ever <unk> the best drink, you have <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then besides showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> make it <unk> -- MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The film of the film is transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the whole idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money does it have to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard the meeting with them but certainly it's going to be worth convincing a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, perhaps for the moment that the film comes out to be a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most answers will be a "No."
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> for the film or be I?
JK:
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So, I was like, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yes. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where he goes, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have nothing to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product as many people as possible, to make so many people saw it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media, and the stage in the separate media scenario is not the idea to have that new vehicle worth of attention that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
There was actually no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image is.
See, when you search for <unk> images in Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that came up.
I like a way of <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line that the bigger problem.
You see, we heard about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president, the <unk> even the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to making it really it changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear that's still <unk>
It's <unk>  Like this rare rural path.
And it's too risky.
What else is <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but we want <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and there is him staring at me as a single <unk> said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's <unk>
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanted to help me -- and that's just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take away from the project and go to the companies I was very much in my team.
So what I started on here suddenly -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who do big, big, giant movies, and others who make small, independent films like mine.
And my friends who make films of Hollywood films say that the reason their films are so successful is because of the associated brands they have.
And then my friends who do independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant films of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any point during an interview with someone I can say, "You're cool for this <unk>
You ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you get to you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there would offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like <unk> solid, <unk> <unk> like it.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: Frank: we are a small brand.
<unk> to the kind of smaller films that we <unk> are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, to remind people is the reason that this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you want into the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps up.
How do you keep you cool better, <unk> better <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What about a common guy.
I need to talk to the man from the street, to people like me, to the <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> something unique <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray and things like that.
Usually I carry out as <unk> or the <unk> and the same <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: You know, partly <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I am the kind of pets.
<unk> toys in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my <unk>
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because of the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand Tom, but I often stand up at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that business personality.
If they were able to do it, they could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how your thoughts and feelings are your way of being.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: me from that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which you think about, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work that you do.
All those things come from, and they start in a place and you start in a place and then start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to <unk>
MS: The next one is "This is the best day of my life."
A: how does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird stuff -- I like the weird things.
A: Tell me about the <unk> for what is it next?
What is the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find is now?
Why is it important? What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to be afraid of what kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience. <unk> Great <unk> A: Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but you know, <unk> in your personality of <unk> Professor <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk>
They <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox of them.
And I think a few companies will only get into one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's the nature of <unk> to avoid the things that they're not <unk> -- they are afraid of fear, those elements, and you actually give up something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classical classical here is Apple.
And you can also see here in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and brands all of those things that have gone and come but a <unk> <unk> it's pretty powerful.
MS: A <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to raise your brand, identity or your brand, and what would it be?
You're a <unk> attribute you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold or bold <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical like <unk>
Or are you more about attribute <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You are traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are <unk> stable, familiar, <unk> safe, sacred or wise <unk> like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the end product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we came to tell the story in this film of how now they use MRI to identify the centers of desire in the brain in the brain for both commercial marketing as a movie for movies.
We went to St. Paulo where they've banned advertising to open open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> nothing.
And we went to school districts that companies are getting on their way in the schools with money in the U.S.
And the amazing thing to me is that the projects I've had the greatest answer or the ones I've been most successful are those in which I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went back to the <unk> they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have no better interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? Did you success?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
According to <unk> the movie was launched in January, and from then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a couple of weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> or press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies that we talk about is telling their customers not to be <unk>
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks that in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you get to the people that are pushing them into failure.
I think when you train your employees in loss of risk is preparing their entire company for <unk> of rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to progress is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we're going on, I think we need to give rise to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear is afraid of risk.
From one <unk> at a time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to support the transparency.
Now more than a little bit of honesty is going to go through a long way.
And he said that, with honesty and transparency, all my talk, <unk> <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very many people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check at the name of the TED matrix, the <unk> Foundation, and a check for <unk> to be applied to my care last year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant plant.
The gray boxes that you see are in real time control systems.
If we were able to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're from a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a cash virus from Windows on a laptop used for an engineer to set up this gray, <unk> then we're ready.
This is the <unk> plan.
We started with a <unk>
<unk> enter the orange box <unk> the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we find this.
When we started to research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
That called us the attention, and we started an experiment where we had a <unk> environment, and we saw what happened with this.
So they spent very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a laboratory rat who didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is searching for actively in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it is actually working on that place.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> we don't know what the <unk> is.
Could it be, let's say, for example, a <unk> energy plant -- or a chemical plant in Germany.
They better better than you would find the goal soon.
And so we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed with people who obviously had the whole internal information.
We would have all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much we would bring the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, and a high technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 lines of code.
It looks like old <unk> language.
I want to tell you how we could find this code.
What we were looking for initially was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to <unk> with the real world, with the potential of real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals -- we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections have been <unk>
They are not several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant <unk>
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
He called them and I looked at them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked quite well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the attack goal was slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the <unk> engineers so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't get <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That was a sense, there was a coincidence.
And he got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the <unk> code.
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
So there was no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken after several weeks of hard work.
We had <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to start.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> were to one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
So the small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> is communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We must not worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some really interesting things that we just looked at me.
There is the orange box and the top <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the entry values of the sensors for example, the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and they provide <unk> code that still runs during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these data data data are <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators on the room.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the great steam turbines is going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Obviously, this can't do that a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can get bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a energy plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have any other <unk> to disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional pieces of worms for <unk>
It would be as possible as possible.
And if you made that, with what we <unk> is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals are not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We need to deal with the consequences and better that we start doing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has done public in many sides that people assumes that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower behind this.
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, we <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give it to <unk> abilities or another one that makes users of wheels and show up to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's nothing different from something that is put in the morning, gives you a big force that also increases its speed, and aid, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and machine.
But it's not just that -- you can integrate it and connected it with the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we began to talk about the American soldier who, on average, has to take over her back a 45 <unk> load of 45 pounds, and it's getting <unk> to get more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injury on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from back.
We decided to contemplate this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can get 90 pounds per material for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows to put in <unk> <unk> and performing <unk> movements.
And what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the direction of chairs of wheels -- what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in the way of <unk> in the world.
Like one percent of the entire population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens often very young people, with damage to the spinal cord that when they start their life -- 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that lies very quickly.
Their only option, many times -- by a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had an injury on the neocortical column and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors.
It's completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals to the computer on board, here on the back.
There's also some batteries that give the motors to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it progress with this smooth, very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, by a stranger jump in the air, skiing down it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all the movement out of <unk>
Soon as long after, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never come to <unk>
That happened to be 19 years ago.
So it stole me to the last minute of hope of self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs down to <unk> <unk> and even <unk> in a <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life in the future of future generations -- not just by soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of <unk> to all of them.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of wild Bonobos in the rainforests of Congo.
The Bonobos are along with the chimpanzees, their closest babies.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done a lot of emphasis on this thing in our narratives of human evolution.
But the Bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big, <unk> society is Bonobo in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately the Bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the bush <unk> and it's been very hard to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario that has been recorded by decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in danger the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting meat and deforestation makes it not to fill in a stadium with Bonobos that are in the world -- honestly, we're not quite sure of it.
However, on this land of violence and chaos, you can hear laughter hidden from the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes -- the <unk> not <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to drive conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all of the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, love to play throughout their lifetime.
It's not just a game of children.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Copernican game, you see the same <unk> roots of laughter, the dance and the human ritual and the human.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play you and I want to show you a couple of unique videos of the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about football game.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what she is doing.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is common both in Bonobos as well as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing things unusual things to play -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is more fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young female who is playing with a <unk> water.
I think that as it was, sometimes we played ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that the Bonobo gives us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more and more difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a success to a world that changes we need to play.
But do we get to the most of our game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and human beings alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate to play, you can be the moments in which it's the most urgent time.
So fellow mathematicians, we want to accept us to accept this gift of evolution and play together as they were, creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I am responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, they are <unk> <unk> as a captain of captain in a fire body.
And in our city, where volunteers have to oppose a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability of go.
But still there was a race standing against the other volunteers to get to the captain and figure out what our homework was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just gotten before I was, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- he got first to the captain and he asked him to go up and would save the dog from the owner of the house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money which, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I entered a <unk> building to save a live living because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to believe between the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and bring it to this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It was not exactly what I hoped but I was going on the stairs, at the end of the hall, which went to the fire firemen and that height of the hall, went through the fire or less of the fire and went into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back to the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog in the front doorstep.
<unk> from the house the treasures for the owner of the house where, as he was waiting for her sex to get much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the owner of her home house, and for the brave effort he showed to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling at Robin <unk> like my <unk> as voluntary fireman I witnessed acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also about grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or they're in the <unk> remarkable levels of success, I would like to remind you this this: Don't wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you a <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a park park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life but each day we're going to influence someone's life.
So I trained to <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem odd, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block <unk>
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea modules of a fixed measure that fit together with each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
He called her brick <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's been estimated that they've been made more than 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the block block in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in Bell labs the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> world to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block the transistor allows you to create much larger circuits and more complex, a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was only to experts.
I personally don't know what the building blocks of our time are actually reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they come together through magnets.
So you can't get it wrong in the wrong way.
The bricks have a code of colors.
The green is the sun, the blue is the stream, the pink and the color of color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue one in a green make light.
Can we put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button out of a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We had this <unk> to create more impact and have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it faster or more slow or <unk> it just looks like this button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a increasing collection.
We want all interactions in the world to be able to use bricks and <unk>
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We've given kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light at night, or why the door of an elevator is kept open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also taken <unk> to design schools.
So for example, the designers without expertise in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the design School of Rhode Island, that they don't have any experience in engineering, just and wood and paper and so said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that have actually been an example of <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that has a fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be in the grasp of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the files of design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world is ours.
So I'll go ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for involved in the environment to focus on it.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
Can you take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not.
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, <unk>
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we are supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
We had members of members and we started working with the <unk>
Instead of <unk> to Third World we send them into the wild world.
They made great <unk> they worked with the <unk> workers.
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a New Boston.
Here it appears as if I would find a quote, but what really looks for a quote, but what it really looks for is that someone gets caught by the snow because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by one meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this very <unk> way.
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment, we had a long year.
They realized that the city has never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else -- that citizens were born with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So it made as a good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You embrace <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications that are given last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads in the viral.
A responsible for <unk> City systems to see this app realized that he could use it, not for snow, but for the citizens to accept <unk> <unk>
It's very important that these <unk> of the tsunami, but people have <unk>
So he asks the citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean up sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know nine cities that are going to use it.
And this has been spread without <unk> and natural <unk>
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that by the normal channels would have taken at least two years and side of a few million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California that until the time has taken 2,000 dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that has a program in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form is a kind of shot of warning.
It suggests the best ways to work, not as in private companies, as many people think it should be.
Neither as a technological company, but more well as the Internet itself.
I mean, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the issue of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they were building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to applications that contribute to applications -- every day in their own communities.
They have not given to the government.
Do you feel a great frustration before that but they didn't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave aside the feelings about politics, line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that they put together, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What do we do together because alone don't <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics don't <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately <unk> -- you remember that <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't really know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of health care and information.
It's the place that serves calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the base of official knowledge.
I found nothing. He started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, and put it very strong and see if they were <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
They didn't have that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really has come up with this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash, I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The dynamics of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so you all see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went back to the <unk> I went home.
Good evening, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of government collaboration with distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean by the definition of platform.
I talk about a platform so that people are going to help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
<unk> to two people.
And I could have connected them with government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than government services.
When one neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same thing as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader -- sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government is changing our values and we understand our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and the politics is the surface layer of <unk>
That's why we call it <unk>
And we say that word with a lot contempt.
But it's that <unk> what keeps us in that that we funded as something that operates in our against, that other thing, and a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real government work happens.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk> them.
It's a group of citizens worried that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not a political activism is activism activism <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> to the government, it's time to ask us what we want to leave with our children.
You have to see the big challenges that they are going to face.
They really believe that we get to where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of the <unk>
We can't do without government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the government function so that it can expand to the civil society <unk>
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and he knows it's not that hard to act <unk> you only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members of our members is 28 years old, so I am, I am an older generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They are not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to be able to talk about who you're going to talk about.
They can express your opinions at any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem, you don't really care about doing their voices.
They're using your hands.
They play the work to program applications that will work better for government.
And those applications allow us to use your hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking away -- dumping them a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
We were always able to have cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not just consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that; we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, we'll be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the jails and the death row.
I've spent most of my life in communities in the projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I will be here at TED watching and hearing these stimuli has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here have impact around the world.
On occasions, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here's a fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher may have a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the whole family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with <unk> <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was little, and I looked at her, she was approaching me, and I gave a good <unk>
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk> me.
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> and he was approaching me, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I would give me again and if I was saying yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to catch his time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight, nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at it, and she <unk> and she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, and he said, "Come on the room, and he said, "Come on and said, "Come on, we are two to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside, and he said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just do I want you to <unk> three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "I first want you to tell me that you would always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> like it <unk>
Then he said, "What the second thing I want to do, is you will always do the right thing even though it is the right thing to do.
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that I would never get <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> like it <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South Africa, I have a brother a year older and one sister year.
When I was 14 -- 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package -- I don't know where the <unk> took us to my sister and I went to the forest.
We just got the <unk> of the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> you know, <unk> and you always do the same thing as us.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
And he came up with the strength and the <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this to be a <unk> I mean by the power that has the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to the other that they don't really make sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe to be done.
I think my <unk> believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of diseases with alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to it, we should <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in the parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has changed our world.
In the poor or black, you find so much <unk> as much as many of these facts.
One out of three black men between the 18 and the 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In the urban <unk> around the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore County, Washington to 50 to 60 percent of all young young color are in prison or <unk>
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a criminal system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth is affecting the results.
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The fear policy and anger makes us believe that these are not ours.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work, some good developments curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you had no rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has lost definitely the right to vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years the level of loss of rights will be so high as it was before they <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The U.S. is the only country in the world where a year sentence comes to children in prison.
We have in this country jail for kids, without a chance of coming out there.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people on death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In some sense you've been asking us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by the <unk> crimes but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
From every nine people -- they have identified one who is innocent and liberated from death row.
An innocent mistake, you would have an innocent one on nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation <unk> you would never be able to fly airplanes, if in every nine that you would have <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> <unk> I talk about <unk>
I talk to you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction of the reconstruction and lasted until World War II.
We don't know much about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a kind of defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what has defined their lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell people to stop saying that in our history, deal with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No, argue that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was, obviously, with the segregation and decades of subordination and of separation.
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time I would do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage us with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome the race <unk> without a compromise with truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany leading a death penalty conference.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's good disturbing to listen to what you want.
<unk> is not death in Germany.
We will never be that here."
The room became silent and a lady said, "There's no way that we could ever get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> we started to <unk>
<unk> about this.
How do we feel about a world where a nation like Germany, are going to be <unk> especially if they were in their most <unk>
We couldn't get it out.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these such difficult, the positive and wonderful things they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology -- <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But then <unk> these realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate both things.
I've been talking about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, you know, the ones that will never come to TED.
Do you think about it is, in a way, something that is inside of our being.
It's true that we need to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being <unk> so committed to the intellectual thing.
And with innovation, with creativity. The development is not just the brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also by the convictions of heart.
This is the connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also the dark and the hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, <unk> for spirit, a will for being in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think even in communities as TED, it must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, which allows us to really be truly humans -- if we don't pay attention to attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts are a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the big privilege being a very young lawyer in meeting Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> was called me to say, <unk> comes the lady -- we're going to get together to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I was like, <unk>
So I was going and just the <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and said, "Now, I want to tell me this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population on prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave her all my best speech, and he looked at me and he said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> <unk> put me my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very much but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find a way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is higher to the worst thing that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced if someone says a lie, not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't <unk> it doesn't be a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in people who must be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts of the poverty is the justice.
And finally, I think even though it is very beautiful, very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> we don't judge us by our technology, by our designs, not by our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of a society, the character of a society, not the way they treat rich and powerful people, but in the way they treat the poor, <unk> the prisoners.
Because it is in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do a lot too much.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison and I see my customers of 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> for them to become <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what is not it?
The judge would give him a adult, but I see a child.
I was very late at the late night, by God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't say you are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think of it right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 year-old customer -- black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my 14 black client to be treated like a <unk> <unk> executive in a <unk>
In the <unk> I set out there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country -- there's no ethical but a lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not just <unk> I had sent it to the cut.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to court for this stupid case.
I got into the car and I was really <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally dropped out of the car.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man, <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He's like, "It's you. I said yes.
So I walked up and <unk>
And I sat down in the ear, and I got rid of it.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I entered the audiences.
And when they arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> And we began to argue.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the police cops in the <unk>
Suddenly, not knowing how, the room was full of people by eating it, because we were talking about races, because we talked about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I got to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look down the window and try to hear all that <unk>
And I was walking over here and for there.
Finally, this old black, with the face of concern, went into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
Ten minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> assistant showed up because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant stood on the old black black.
And he said, <unk> what do you do?
And the old black man stood up, he looked at me and he said, "I went to this doctor's room to tell this young man who keeps his view in the goal of <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds up to justice.
That we can't really really be <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for the dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity has to join the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that they'll keep the view in the goal of <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Just try to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes, to do something.
Something is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several different opportunities in it.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to be an effort to <unk> the funds they spend today in terms of punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars a death row in the next five years, one billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of <unk> cases are not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of rapes come to nothing.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to come up to come up with these funds to make the law, to the security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who think is it?
<unk> Actually, the <unk> rate has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong <unk> war.
That's why this dramatic increase in the population <unk>
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people through the <unk> chain to steal a bicycle, for small crimes against property, instead of making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited about here here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months. It could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media would prefer <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of our senses -- our senses are getting so much more data than the brain can probably be made.
And as nothing matters more than to survive, the first stop of all of this data is an old little bit of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the <unk> detector.
<unk> and records all of the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
And so from a <unk> of stories, you know, look at the negative.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day -- no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe instead of what happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, <unk> scarcity of water, scarcity of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long long long of the long time, we just have them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> average income per capita in inflation has <unk> across the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, from transportation and communication, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy has 25 percent to more than 80 percent of the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people were doing it.
And we keep looking at higher expectations more and higher expectations.
In fact, they <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., much of the people who live under the poverty line are electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators -- mobile television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
So let's take a lot of this is technology, and we bring it up its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps in this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price of about 12 to 24 months.
And so the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First, the soft thing is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in depression and <unk>
It's the building of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> by Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> are endless computing and sensors and <unk> robotics, the 3D printing and its ability to democratize the personalized production of the planet, physical biology, the fuels and food and food, digital medicine -- <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" Watson, of <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: He loved this: <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
He plays the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of your mobile phone.
Four years ago here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can we be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a service or service, which can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
We can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> it's about creating a life of it.
It's about taking it to do that that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story from Napoleon Three in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops from Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the Washington is <unk>
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like a pure metal metal here.
It's tied to oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came up and made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
So we would take this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet -- by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get the Earth 16 percent of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about scarcity, it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated per capita by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, solar power will cost six cents a <unk> compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed at the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after it happened.
It was a famous famous picture. How did it be <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought by the <unk> of the planet, but here's a hope.
It's a technology that is available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you with you, he gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator size.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water by the day of any single source <unk> saltwater, <unk> water, a <unk> by less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke ended up doing a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that it would be, Coca-Cola is going to be Coke in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a bottom-up innovation by this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the end of the end of 2013.
<unk> that Lakota warrior has better mobile communications communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan is 25 years ago.
And from counting with a smartphone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton did 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have predicted before.
Even better than that, the things that you and I have paid for tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video -- video -- images, images of books and music, technology -- <unk> diagnostic technology, and they are now <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe it is the best thing to get when the mobile app is.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation -- something called the <unk> X <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we have these technologies in a mobile device that you talk about, and because they have <unk> they can get blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there are no doctors, where the <unk> burden is 25 percent of the health care workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that doesn't mean to call the health and the first place, to prevent the pandemic happening.
But this is the highest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it a billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just passed the mark of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, we had two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion to five billion of the Internet users.
Three billion minds never before we get to the global conversation.
What do you want these people?
What would you do? What wishes you <unk>
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars <unk> in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health because of the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion more members of humanity, healthy educated and <unk>
What about a voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and be able to act for the first time?
What did these <unk> <unk>
And if you are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X Prize, is that small teams guided by his passion with an objective of of course, can do things that were <unk> things that before only they could make big corporations and the governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold up the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this university professors with each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined up and started <unk>
And it's shown today that today the machinery of human patterns is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the <unk> of <unk>
We have the <unk> capital.
And we have three billion new minds that are going to be <unk> to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few decades in front of decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you will give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
They probably believed that they were <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross in the <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they follow <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story also illustrates the concept of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying one county in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from a few <unk>
There were about 20 kilometers away, the black beard, <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and it was going on for a good moment, so it was much more than the middle of Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had declined in half.
I went to the five inches.
<unk> a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was imposing the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> fishing fishing.
And this boat, pretty good, the <unk>
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in southern China, and especially in the <unk> Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> now -- the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the bottom.
And most of the fish are blobs of little things about <unk> remains of the coral reef fish.
In short, the sea bottom came over the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start the commercial fishing begins.
The bottom is about being a solid background of soft coral in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> the <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I wasn't <unk>
And so they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect the fishermen whenever they go to a zone where they never have fish.
But it's not <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
You know, the start point of starting to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, as many of the <unk> and the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use the <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the event of changes.
And at the end of the end, keeping a few <unk> remains.
And that, in great extent, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem is affecting people when societies <unk> they kill animals without knowing what they've done until about generations later.
Because, obviously, one animal that is very prevalent before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose <unk> animals.
One lost little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a big ocean of big fish.
They become little <unk> because <unk>
We have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way, it's not the way they would expect to have the evidence.
So for example, the anecdote that some <unk> like captain as a captain and I looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or generally use the scientists of fish, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that can fulfill a protected area.
Because with the marine protected zones we really recreated the past.
So let's get the past that people can't think about because the starting point has been run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine area and can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like people in the West -- for example?
I think there are the arts and cinema maybe can fill the vacuum.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people were moved with the movie <unk> talk about the story of <unk> why they are <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that giving, is to Cameron <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are being made of their own, and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger -- that seemed something very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper notoriety in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They climb over 48 hours of video YouTube per minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of a percentage makes a bunch of visits and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and a surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video out of his house in the National Park National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views of the popularity of last summer.
<unk> was not proposed to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I'd already published a lot of videos.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this <unk> that <unk> the <unk>
The trends as Jimmy <unk> they present us with new and interesting things to a wider audience.
RS: <unk>  It's Friday, carefully -- you have to start on the end of week, the weekend.   And you all want you to get out the end of the week, the weekend.   <unk> Friday. <unk> on a Friday.  KA: We wouldn't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of RS: Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the use of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, he was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science -- was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trends are going to take a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience, and it will rise the process.
So, this community of people who shares this great joke inside the internal joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there's 10,000 <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
That's it. That's it.
This year they saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there is a three hours version that has been seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the <unk> community of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Somebody did one version of the old version.
And then it became international <unk>
Suddenly, I came up with a whole community of <unk> that made this going from being a silly joke to something that we can all form part.
Because it's not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or RS: Black or <unk> <unk>
What would you know might have been written by this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video for minute, only that really unexpected and unexpected can actually figure out how these things have done.
When a friend of mine told me that I had to see this great video of a kind that protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't get too interested in it.
Casey Casey <unk> were <unk> by the <unk> but there are often obstacles that keep you cells properly <unk>
KA: Thank you to surprise the surprise and their humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all the new things that we do <unk>
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend, the creative communities of participation, totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of culture, of a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of the popular.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They didn't get permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media, and it's just the current media -- but we have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only one and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much time I'm trying now to do it.
They lie in silence.
He died for the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was trying to <unk> but I did it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat <unk> <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been meant to a <unk> task for her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that it challenges the fiction, a boat goes down to the sea bottle of ship ship.
All adults knew about risks.
The greatest fear were <unk> rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk>
And if we were wondering, first we'd take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> diving on every wave, and vast and a vacuum.
I don't remember the hackers who came a number of times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the <unk> were dying and not being able to start to start by six hours.
But I know the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, finish the journey was too much to it; and the first apple that I did, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> -- whose population is comprised of immigrants from it.
Unlike the suburbs of average, whose existence was <unk> in <unk> no sense of the right.
The smells of the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a <unk> assembly line, working six days, <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a headline in IT <unk>
We were poor.
All of dollars were <unk> and there was a <unk> extra <unk> in English and mathematics, you wouldn't mind what was supposed to be, which was usually <unk> <unk>
Two pairs of middle pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> about <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home."
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice saying, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we got rid of our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother suffered from <unk> all of the ship.
And my job was to be wakes up until his nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition and angry and <unk> and <unk> boys trapped between two worlds.
They looked at subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, I was the classic <unk> student, praying with what I <unk> from myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, abuse and <unk>
But a lot of they received help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of Canada, they chose the Australian young Australian daughter.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges didn't get there.
So <unk> <unk> <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk about sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire to the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age as she was on the ship.
He couldn't have been an option.
<unk> told me, "What don't you <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to the marginalized and <unk>
And the more I was talking about it, the more I was about <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they were living in the border of the possible.
And although I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> career.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger -- new to the scene -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that is going to be grateful, maybe a ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
And I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, a <unk> optimism mix and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
So let's put a little group of people for those who <unk> <unk> <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we had no <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant array of soup that all <unk>
<unk> to the night at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant, and we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single trip.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure.
Before I finished, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
At 17 years became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of her husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and he will bring the cause of her, and so much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't make it proved <unk>
I was in the shower in the room in a hotel room, when she died, to <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and we make sure that we were still with it.
On night a monk came up and told us he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from <unk> he said.
"You have no <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since that we were and how life built us, we can now see that men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The loss would be easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could want that to know?
However, I fear the privilege of the right of right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, you're going to try to brave in each wave, the constant rate of the engine, the vast rate of engine, the vast skyline that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could take them and see them a secure thing to do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky.
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians we wanted to travel to a car and get them into the sky.
We now do it with airplanes.
So at that time, when you outsource the great prince warrior Indian warrior -- he had <unk> <unk> a bow and a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that struck me a lot.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would tell you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't help my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic, not <unk>
When my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this particular piece of 50 years was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it to <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
And so I became <unk> I threw this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
I was flying books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how to take the book out.
Where we are.
Put the text with the image, the animation, the sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what is it for us?
I'm about to launch an interactive app for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I go back to a character of the book.
In several times it comes to a <unk> -- the iPad, he knows where I live through GPS -- that comes led to me.
My little girl inside is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to the magic of childhood, those ideas that we love from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always exciting.
So here we need to shift the iPad to release the fireflies.
And actually, they light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I move into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all of a fantasy book, there has always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and you guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book they were <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another very important aspect of me is to create Indian content and the contemporary of contemporary people.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the <unk> and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts in India, the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old <unk> book.
So we're bringing it back into a child <unk>
In a story that deals with today, as the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not left to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
I had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, children don't do it.
So in order to regain this childhood ritual you have to go out and, in a chapter, I would take a photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A little kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Inside the variants of connection between magic, the Earth and technology is many possibilities.
In the next book, we asked to have an interaction where you get out with the iPad, and the video turned out and through an augmented reality that you see a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants of the house.
At one point the screen is full of leaves with it.
And you have to do the sound of wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology approach one another.
<unk> the power of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that we all do, or perhaps not all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale that's very simple.
It has a <unk> <unk>
Every morning I get upset.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge of getting to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time when I need <unk> or some urgency of that style, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I go up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can lead to the people of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
And from the week next to be available today.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people who are <unk> from their homes, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor and share with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients take a position, they get back to control and being captains of their own <unk> but it can also help care of health because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the cost of attention <unk> the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did to do with you with a video video.
We all have controls, in the <unk>
Maybe we have our phones.
We know where the ATM machines are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find very fast food.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked ourselves but no one <unk>
No one knew where to get <unk> saves lives at this time.
What we did was we do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> and other people are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks will use your cellphone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to take them globally.
We're scratching all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that they will help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
And I also want to invite companies all over the world that could help us realize these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in their place.
Please do it in this and not just improve your health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, it's photographs that you can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15.
I mixed with my <unk> passion for the drawing, but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera the process was in planning in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk> <unk>
For me, photography had more to be in the right place at the right time.
It seemed that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by press the <unk>
And they were looking at this one: a building on a very small road <unk>
But it has a twist on it.
And even though it holds a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the time, but with the common goal to keep the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can do that, but I always want it to be captured in some way like photograph.
<unk> where you will have to think of a moment to discover the trick.
It has more than to do with capturing an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them real <unk>
Are the details or the <unk>
Do you get the light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But at the end of this is our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here's three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways can create something that still looks like <unk> as if that was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's move into the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like any realistic picture I think are those in which we don't even know the things that are around us in our daily lives.
But when I combine photographs is very important to <unk> because otherwise something looks wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second of all, the <unk> pictures must have the same kind of light.
And these two images with these <unk> were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is impossible to distinguish the beginning and end of different images with a perfect age.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of different places.
In the personal thing, I think it's easier to create a place that will find it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that have on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months in order to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> part was captured on a <unk>
And yes, even I did a red house on the top of the island so that it looks more <unk>
So in order to make a realistic outcome, I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures that you can be very beautiful and at the very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a little bit about technology, very boring.
If you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general aspect of it.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as a lot of other people we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves that is a novel thing.
Here's something strange.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn up the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we use tech curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them into a regular curve in which, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to <unk> the diagram would see something ludicrous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't mean a lot.
But if you ask me, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it becomes a <unk> shift.
If the technology of shipping was as fast as the past <unk> we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But don't go through that rhythm.
There is no unprecedented <unk> in the history of technological development that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to ask to do is -- looking at these <unk> curves we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to sustain this as fast as it goes.
It was one of two things.
Or it's okay to become a typical curve. I know like this until something completely different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is, what is that new shape <unk>
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
That happens a transformation. Can we feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we are doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time when I'd like to do this is time for life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we go back a few two and a half thousand years ago when the Earth was a great <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that were <unk> around them.
If we look at the way that those chemicals organize us, we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories in order to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that moment, there was a simple version of oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside it.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside and the droplets grew a particular combination of <unk>
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you were <unk> <unk> a distribution of chemicals that we have.
So every <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow became better at the time to incorporate the chemical <unk> more <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
They were usually spending more time, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, very simple chemistry, but things get interesting when these blobs learned the trick of abstraction.
In some ways we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, I think about this evolution without any sense, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were to be able to do for it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since evolved 2.5 million years ago.
Our recipe, our genes are exactly the same code, that same type of writing.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did only for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and it took it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to be 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus, and it would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things are going to be very different from the things that things were very different and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information forming the cell community.
I don't know if you know, bacteria can exchange DNA.
That way, for example, evolved the resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and established a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whatever if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community became more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point came up when these communities were approached when they actually came together, and they decided to write all the recipe from the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities <unk> communities of many different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level that happened within these communities.
They started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than processing information in community.
It's <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell phones built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being responsible for <unk> to understand and to convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not to the time of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn to not eat some fruits because I knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because before they had built these information processing structures that have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals that ate that fruit processing structures.
So the fact that the nervous system build those information structures accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time we need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version of us is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an amazing invention.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea in your head.
I'm here I am sitting here emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads, who holds some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated and we turn it into sound, on sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
Now we went through periods of similar periods of <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods of <unk> presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape -- the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us together in something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we were doing before.
Now evolution can happen in overlooked.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program, in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I told you about took a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years old.
The following, the language and so on, took less than a million years.
And beyond, like electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make a life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without recent history.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to behave in a conventional way.
I don't know that it makes every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that does something that you can't do, it gets far further away and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes you use methods that we don't even understand right.
A particularly interesting method I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates at the scale of the past.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences of instructions to chance?
You could run these <unk> instructions at random -- running all those programs, and take those who are more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to note numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to certain numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, could we find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now we need the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, that <unk> <unk> and that the children will have the properties of both of these programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that had a little more successful <unk>
And we say, "Please, repeat the <unk>
Let's bring it back again.
So a few mutations would happen.
And it tries to come back and forth with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complex cases in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that we separate numbers in the end, absolutely perfect <unk>
In fact, it's really much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze this to see how they work.
It's dark programs -- strangers.
But they get <unk>
In fact, I know that, I have the safety of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that would have succeeded.
In fact, their lives depend on doing it.
Once I was going into a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he gets a card and he says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight. It doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they're becoming complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to do very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the options that are there.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to do much faster computers and so they can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment of analog organisms when they became <unk>
We're the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now it comes the lunch and I think I'll stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give me a part of my false minds.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, we talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's for <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and to use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called average, <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball into the field of game without being <unk> and anyone who tries to engage the first base, not to get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that is someone who is 10 <unk> it hit four.
<unk> like legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the League of <unk> <unk> in running 400 strokes in a regular season in a regular season.
Now you know, this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable and maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are <unk> to a surgeon who has a <unk> record <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place away and a dear to have two arteries -- <unk> <unk> and your family doctor is derived to a cardiologist whose record is 200 <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting really much better this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But let me ask you.
What do you think should be the average hits of a heart surgeon, or <unk> of a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
It's very good.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them to the world, and I would call myself the <unk> to be perfect.
I never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a literary student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs studied to a blood test.
That's which.
<unk> in my little <unk> at the residence of the General <unk> Hospital was not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis, how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as you get more and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if you were going to do everything, then you would know everything, or as possible, as possible, as possible, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here in Toronto when they brought the lady back to the emergency service, where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I applied to a cardiologist I was going to attend to that patient.
And I was reporting to the chief of Africa's residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides -- what <unk> a heart heart failure.
And in these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, and they fill them from blood, and so there is difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I was given.
I gave it <unk> and medication to ease the pressure on their heart.
He gave him a <unk> of water, so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And there was when I made the first <unk> I emailed it to her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent it to his house without talking to the chief <unk>
I didn't get up the phone or I did whatever I should do, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, I would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that would make constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send her home, I didn't take attention to a voice on my inner voice that would say, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so confident that until I asked the nurse that I was going to say to the lady who was saying, "Do you believe it's okay if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, "Yes, I think I'm fine."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
And so he was writing high, and the ambulance together with the ambulance and her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a <unk> in the stomach.
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I would be able to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where I was my car to go home. So I did something that I don't usually do normally, at that point.
I went through the emergency service service at home.
And there is another nurse, not the <unk> of the lady <unk> before, but another one said to me three words, those three words that most emergency medical doctors.
Other specialists fear them too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are remembers right?
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I came back and on the edge of death.
After an hour of getting back to their home, after I gave her the high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance were brought into the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock severe <unk>
I just breathe and it was blue.
The emergency staff would have all their resources.
They gave it medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the spinal cord.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and expected against every hope that was <unk>
And in the two or three days it was obvious that I never had to do.
He had a <unk> disease.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was going to be happening to what was happening.
And at the ninth day, he stopped him to go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
So the next few weeks, I was blown away by it and experienced the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I was just, <unk> <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we are bad.
And that meant it.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would take things out and made sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why sent it to her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made a mistake that <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
Little recently that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on one day <unk> was opened up the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with me in which if I would raise the efforts to be perfect to not make any more errors, they would do your voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was setting the emergency department in a community hospital in the North Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed up here.
I looked into her throat, he was a little <unk>
He was charged with penicillin and sent him back home.
But as he ran to the door he was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> <unk> my boss, I was asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I gave the three words: Does it remember you?
Remember the patient he saw by a pain in <unk>
He came back and he didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but the top, and that can cause the close to those tracks.
He said, fortunately, she didn't die.
They were <unk> antibiotics for <unk> and recovered at a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened over and over again, and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the emergency <unk> I didn't get <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> by 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
It turns out an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out to be normal. A colleague who was looking at the patient <unk> some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, and called the surgeon to a surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
He made a liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it and notice some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, called the surgeon.
They both were operated and recovered well.
But every case I get rid of me <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
And here is the problem: If I can't get my own, and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- trust that I would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
This is the system that there are two <unk> who make mistakes and who don't even sleep that you can't sleep and the ones that don't sleep and the ones who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that you're starting to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get rid of medicine to people who make mistakes, we're going to get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and journalism -- I've made a personal study of bad medical litigation and mistakes in order to learn how to the first paper that I wrote for the Star Toronto to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked on a system where errors happen every single day, where one in 10 percent of 10 drugs, <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system in which <unk> infections, are increasingly, and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 24,000 Canadian <unk> by young medical errors.
The U.S. Institute of Medicine built 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is added every two or three years, and we didn't get <unk>
The sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and suddenly my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't have their symptoms always in the same way.
For all of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals who are likely to be wrong -- well, not going to be anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> white, white art, it's already a habit saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, this is my worst <unk>  I would tell everybody, from the <unk> to the head of surgery <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah blah -- "What are your <unk> And you get the microphone into them.
And their students were <unk> and they will slow down your head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't you make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> doctor is human, and you accept it, and it's not proud of his errors, but it comes to learning about what happened to teach others.
They have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
You know, errors in other people don't intend to <unk> but in a loving love and support for all of them.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes humans to run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, you know, errors errors.
And I feel so much but it effort to learn something that can transmit to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
Recently I did a survey of more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices he says to pick up an American American.
Not a lot, in a research on a week to a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks -- for these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> work a week.
Naturally, every job included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about your elections.
Do you know how many people belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How is the way it deals with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose to the overload of options.
I want to talk about the problem and about potential solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I do a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Another way, when I do a question, if your answer is positive for please give you a <unk>
And now my first day, you're ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this high-level supermarket at least in that time was very sophisticated <unk>
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and <unk> of <unk> water, and this was when we were taking water from the <unk>
I loved going to that store, but at one occasion, I asked myself, why never bought nothing?
This is the shelf oil <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in the box <unk> that were coming from <unk> trees.
And once I decided to visit the manager and asked him, I would try to do well this strategy of offering all of these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment. This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of things.
<unk> a post for <unk> just to the entrance store.
We put out of six <unk> or six different flavors and we see two things: First, what case people were willing to stop <unk> <unk>
More people stopped when there were a smaller 60 than when there were only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
When they stopped when there was only three percent arrived in a <unk>
What stood up when there was six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably <unk> less -- less is good to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of choices is affecting us very well <unk>
We decided not to decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at decisions about savings for retirement for a million Americans, between a million of 650 dollars from this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of money funds available in retirement plans for retirement, the <unk> program will save people to save the future.
And we found that I really had a <unk>
We had <unk> that were going from two to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding -- there was less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that they offer two funding, the death rate was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that was offered about 60 funding, the death rate went to the '60s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the more the number of choice, more people are going to get rid of their actions or hedge hedge funds.
As much more choice, they were more willing to invest in financial interventions.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we can do to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences for offering you more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we will make the decision that <unk> even though this is going against the self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively it go better.
The main reason is that we would be able to look at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparing them to just contrast and choose that amazing <unk>
Today I want to show you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one shape or another, in different research so that they can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard earlier, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than that.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at is that if you choose to cut, get rid of your strange strange choices, there will be a <unk> increase in sales, there will be a better experience in the election.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, they saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation Gate <unk> eliminated the products for garbage -- of cats that are less <unk> they raised the <unk> in <unk> for two more sales and minor <unk>
You know that the supermarkets today is about 45 products.
In a <unk> store is about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world now is <unk> and it's just 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce kind of tomato sauce."
In the financial trade, I think that one of the best examples that have come over how to handle the best choices is the <unk> of David <unk> the <unk> program.
All the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a safety of life.
For those of you who really want a choose, they give them 20 funding, not 300 or more.
You know, people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They are all demanding options.
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> the differences that there are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't do their <unk> either.
This evening, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience on a vacation with all paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a round of applause.
<unk> <unk> OK. Anyone who's ready to accept the deal.
It's not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first trial, than in the second, but I can tell you that they thought that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the <unk> problem that is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very <unk>
Why reason people spend 15 percent more on average, when they use debit card or credit cards that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more positive people.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were working on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were being applied to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting, we <unk> exactly how we <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that I would give you the staff that you would think of the positive things that you would put in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a rise in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a hallway of magazines.
We saw that in the supermarkets on the <unk> of <unk> the exhibition of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This rating scheme is totally useless.
The categories need to indicate something that we would find out that <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge <unk>
And I mean who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can drive a lot more information than we think about, if you only have a little bit more <unk>
We need to increase social complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very good decision buying a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allow us to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that each.
<unk> outside of the car. I've got 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> box <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order in which the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from a lot of choice, 56 colors, just about four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go to <unk> options, four <unk> to 56 colors, lots of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How much are you doing?"
If you <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that the ones that go from a lot of choices to <unk> <unk> button and again, and another more.
<unk>
If you go in a few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order where the information is.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the choice of changes don't say anything about the preferences of interior <unk> in all ways you make us to choose.
We are excited about a product that we're building that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternatives -- <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with fewer <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I have presented were designed to help drive the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who are going to work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful about <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in East Germany -- if you had a writing machine I had to do it with the government.
I had to register a piece of text text with the machine.
And this for the government to track the origin of texts.
If they found one written with the wrong message, they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't conceive of someone who could do this, how much this would -- the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and printing a page, that page will end with a little yellow little print on each page that follows a pattern that makes them just and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three major causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to make a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are actually a lot of <unk> online, <unk> that they would make money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys make their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal means by illegal media to steal money from our bills when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought it in a <unk> computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know his <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us is a victim of an actual <unk>
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most crimes are online online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, the protests, they motivate them the protests, they motivate laughter laughter.
groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a huge role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who do to protest and the last group are the United States of the United States and the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the <unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
You would get the security of the site and lead a <unk>
The last week I asked at a meeting with Dutch government representatives asked one of the leaders if <unk> <unk> the death of people to cause the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a suicide attack.
<unk> is an Indian authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do they serve them?
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign foreign authority of it.
And that was happening to <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the <unk> protesters headquarters in April secret police headquarters in April <unk> and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes of a company in Germany in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a lot of the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool by 280 euros to the government <unk>
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools to <unk> governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But it goes further.
They <unk> the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think about things like these things like these obvious response should be "Well, it looks like something wrong, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's <unk>
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
So if we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that you would spend today, it will be forever.
They were paralyzed by any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that are concerned about the next 50 years.
This is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the South Park of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad at the background, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we raised in the morning and we found it very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, we think we came from from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
They were dying are warriors who protect our community and cattle, and they are also mad with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there's so few in Yellowstone National Park.
A child in my community, from six to the nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of their father and this was the same thing that I was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were afraid to be afraid.
But I realized that actually this is not <unk> because it even helped the lions to see the pen away.
I didn't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions and they believed that it was about the <unk>
But lions are very smart.  They came up with the first day and saw the <unk> and they were like, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing isn't moving, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed them.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come out.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that they move.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch to turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the small box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> go out there, because that's where the lions.
And this is how you see lions when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions to think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them on my house two years ago, and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the houses in the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
<unk> you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by Kenya, <unk> to other predators like hyenas, <unk> and it's also using it to get rid of these farms.
Because of this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise money and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the <unk> of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see flying airplanes, and I was saying that one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to become a engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions with no conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture what's exciting to listen to a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do one near electric power, one near <unk>
<unk> I know you already have invented <unk> but I want to make mine.
CA: So I would do it once, right? And <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I just got out because I got a <unk>  CA: When Richard <unk> Richard <unk> are a big thing.
We're going to <unk> in every step that I would have a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would do all the time studying Kim <unk> story, but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea are enemies.
But sometimes I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and myself were never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When you do this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, that we're prepared to die."
I was very altered
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering from my country.
At the time when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was alive in the street, holding a child <unk> in her arms looking at his face of her mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A massive famine led to North Korea to the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except by the lights in the sea in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture from North Korea at night compared to the countries of the neighbors.
This is the <unk> River, which serves the boundary between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing Koreans to cross <unk>
But many of them die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river, basically.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with <unk> relatives
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take for 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but it's also dangerous, because the refugee refugees in China were illegal illegal immigrants in China.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually actually when I was arrested for the Chinese police and I ran in the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer told the other, "This was a fake report, and she's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking at <unk> in <unk>
But many can be arrested for the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although it had been eventually released after an international blood pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to leave, many other Koreans have not had so lucky.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can be done in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to have a risk going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I was expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through a piece of identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call with pride for mine.
Even though I went to the life in South Korea it was not easy, I started studying a plan. I started studying for college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea authorities had a little bit of money I sent to my family, and as a punishment -- my family was going to be shifted to the force to a place that was removed in the <unk>
They had to run off.
So I started planning to help them escape.
The North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took one week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by the Chinese police officer.
He asked the identification of all of us and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, and I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me, but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards in <unk>
But even after switching the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated by crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I made everything to release my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at short of the South Korea.
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost the hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a ask ask, "What is the problem?"
I was so shocked that a stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary with a dictionary, I would tell him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of money for my family and for another two North Koreans and <unk>
I read it all my heart, and I said, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown stranger is a new hope for me and for the people to be able to get the <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people are needed.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea.
But getting their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice of English language practices and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us are still in contact with family but we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans around the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> stores -- fast food, <unk>
So the city planners got together and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Center so that it represents something else, so they changed to Los Angeles in the South Los Angeles as if this is actually wrong in the city.
This is the Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a food desert, Los Angeles <unk> home to the food places to bring and eat in the car.
What's funny is that the places of food for bringing people more people out of food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles <unk>
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, <unk> <unk> that's like 15 miles away.
And I was trying to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see <unk> wheels and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and it's the solution.
In addition to me I got tired of driving 45 minutes and back to buy an apple that has no <unk>
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet x 3 feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to run it up.
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm going to come in, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This was how I decided to run it up.
So my group and I, L.A. <unk> we got together, and we started planting our food of food, trees -- <unk> -- you know, the nine fresh vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of group paid ahead of the way ahead of the entire city, and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city was on top of it, and they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to take my yard, the <unk> became <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A criminal order for planting food on a piece of land that no one <unk>  So I was like, "Well, I exist."
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the Green <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say, <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It's got 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That is enough space to plant <unk> million <unk>
Why on Earth does it not look like this?
We would build a thousand seeds. A thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for the South <unk>
I grew up there. I was there.
I was going to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
The gardening is my <unk> I grew up my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
They were <unk> to see what the earth can do, if they stop it to be their canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education, of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They were trying to see how kids affect it.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and provocative act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my backyard, and they looked very <unk>
I, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who was so close to me, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, "We don't think people will steal your <unk>
And so I say, "Why? I don't have a fear that you're going to go to <unk>
That's on the street.
That's what this is about.
I want the <unk> but at his time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden into a <unk> shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
And they were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, and he gave me their stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant with her mom and <unk> and it was great to see how this changed, and it was just a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 garden.
We've had about 50 people that come, work and <unk> all in a voluntary plan.
If the kids are growing up, the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this are going to be taught how the food affects your mind and your body, they eat blind to put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which you're thinking about, I see the color boys that are on this way that is designed for them, that it doesn't take them nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these guys to get rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to wear <unk> and turn them into healthy <unk>
I didn't get <unk>
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
What's funny about sustainability is that you have to <unk>
So what I'm talking about is to put people to work to the streets of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening the farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you take your <unk> take your <unk> OK?
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to look at me, you don't call me comfortable and having meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so that we could plant something.
strong. Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road here.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, not in days as today, where it rains, a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that <unk>
And especially if you go <unk> in your bicycle and these cars go out, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, would we want a quiet path.
The solution for that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
So the asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it, so all the water of rain goes down to the sides and you will have a road for which it's easy to drive, and you don't get water in the water.
The noise also will disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very <unk> all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet path.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is it <unk> You see that on this road the stones on the surface of it.
First of all, a stone, then several more and more and more, etc., you know, you won't do that.  But you can hurt your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more harm.
Sometimes you can create <unk> with that.
<unk> He's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see the damage in this material.
This is a <unk> asphalt as I said, so only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> light -- the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> is <unk> and if you get <unk> they will be <unk> and they <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of materials from <unk>
If we can make this material, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is we can use steel <unk> of that to clean <unk> and we can cut out <unk> <unk> <unk> and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel <unk>
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you need to do is to heat the steel -- melt the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
Today I used an oven, <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here to the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the exhibition, I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that it comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We need to <unk>
So it gave us a piece of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> in which we had to make a test <unk> to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road last several years without any harm.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did aging in the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and then with our <unk> machine, and we went back to try it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using steel fibers incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life on the surface of the road, even you can double the life on the surface of the surface -- they actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's quite hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how it looks like it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening News in his little gray radio.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at the time, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> <unk> my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban stood up from Afghanistan and they made illegal girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I became a little kid in order to get my older sister to my older sister that I couldn't just be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we would take a different route so that no one could be suspicious about where they are.
We had to hide books in a market shop so that it seems that we were shopping.
The school was at a home, more than 100 of us a little bit of a living room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we were going to take our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
And once in a while, the school was suddenly <unk> for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters was a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in which his daughter, my mother, was to school and that his father was <unk>
But my mother got a teacher.
This is it.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our home in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk to not educate their children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated for our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father would say, <unk> daughter, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money, you can try to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So you still want to <unk>
I have 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than high school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here proud to graduate school in <unk>
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> his home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He didn't just get rid of my university degree, but I also was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, that I carry it through the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
This is because of what we did, <unk> the first private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> by them, despite the way in front of a opposition <unk>
It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went from the way from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a pump in the way, for minutes.
When I arrived at her home, they are the phone, a voice would tell you that if he kept sending her daughter to school, they would get it to try.
<unk> now, if you <unk> he said, "but not hurt the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who have <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school has been taught in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
They were hoping that these changes not last long after the retirement U.S. soldiers in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that <unk> I see a <unk> future and lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities <unk> and every day the girls of <unk> was <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you will never go back.
It's almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much from the <unk> revolution in the <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> within and outside the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a big revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> each of the regime, they are carrying billboards for freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a courage to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the west, the south.
Finally, after a six months of the brutal war and a few losses from about 50,000 dead -- we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk> <unk>
For four decades, the Tunisian regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have asked a few other women, and we rebuild the civilian society <unk> a <unk> and fair transition to democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation
There are about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about the development of capabilities, and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women -- <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, <unk> <unk> and very <unk> <unk> to advocate for the <unk> of the woman and for our right of participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was getting more and more <unk> than the selfish policies of domination.
Over time, our initiative was destined and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in 52 years.
However, little recently, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the American ambassador, and the attack to the <unk>
Another day woke up with the news of the official murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> rapes of human rights and their lack of the law.
Our society, made up by a revolutionary mindset -- more, and it has been away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had at the beginning.
The <unk> and the revenge became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
So I'm not here today to deal with us with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
Rather, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, choose wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> they brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination, and <unk> for men as for women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, and <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus than the choices that we only need the election and the <unk>
Our nation needs the feminine representation of female most of the most likely representation of the <unk> and quantitative <unk>
We need to stop acting as agents of crisis and call it to anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female discourse that not only <unk> but to put it in practice <unk> instead of the <unk> the collaboration instead of competence, inclusion is instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that an Libya, <unk> by war, needs desperately to reach the end of peace.
Because peace has a <unk> that tries to <unk> and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> who is known in all <unk> traditions has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> women and <unk> that spans all of the humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the tribes have been <unk>
And so, just like the uterus completely covers the <unk> which grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion to provide all the existence.
And so we said, "My mercy gets all the stuff."
This is what you get to tell us, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
They are all <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a <unk> question, which has such an answer as well.
This is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is what everybody is going to do.
Why was someone going to stay with a man who would <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no expert on domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
I was 22 years old, I was just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, I had my first <unk> Green <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I create my soul <unk> I would join my head with a <unk> <unk> with bullets from <unk>
The man, when I loved anyone in this world, put a gun into my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for the list of <unk> <unk> <unk> between these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington, <unk>
I have almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the race, all religions, all religions, all the levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse is men, and the domestic abuse is just in the families, the last place where we might want or expect to or find <unk> for which, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who would stick with a man who does it, and I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States of age 16, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and <unk> night.
I was sitting next to the subway in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He said two things.
The first one was that he had had a <unk> university of the <unk> <unk> and he worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field of the field.
He had a little bit of <unk> and <unk> and a hair <unk> and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that he made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of <unk>
He did it especially at the beginning of the <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and he loved all of me -- that he was ready that he had gone to Harvard, who stood a passion in helping teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a woman, and as a woman, as nobody had ever done it.
And it was why the bachelor's in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I was going to go from New York to leave the work of my dreams, but I thought that I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I decided to quit my job and <unk> and I went out of Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a <unk> <unk> who was entering the head of a physical trap. financial and psychological psychological <unk>
The next step in domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it goes.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to the New England you know, that site where they were supposed to be so safe to be bought by three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another was kept under the pillow on our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed those guns to cause those guns to cause the trauma that lived with.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me and even though I had never been lifted my hand, my life was now serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were the seven in the morning and still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's <unk> and married him.
Despite what had occurred, I was sure that we were living happy forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of being a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I never would make any harm.
I spent two times more on our moon.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and I stood up, and he turned to me as strong in the head that <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon, and he threw up the traffic and threw up a Big Mac on the face.
<unk> followed by <unk> one or two times a week for the next two and a half year-old marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I was very good company.
Going back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love in love with a profoundly <unk> man and was the only person in the world that could help <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question around the world is why not just <unk>
Why didn't I get <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the most sad and painful question that people do, because we asked us, the victims, we know something that you are normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the mass violence cases happen after the victim has been late after <unk> because then <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has returned to married, <unk> from financial resources, and of our family justice system and their children, who normally are forced by judges to spend time not to <unk> with the man who would give their mother.
And then we still ask, why don't it just be <unk>
I was able to go, because of a last <unk> beat up that beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if there was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told all the world: the police, my neighbors, my neighbors, my friends and family and <unk> and I'm here today, because all of you are <unk>
We have the trend to <unk> victims as <unk> <unk> women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
For some people this is a way to say <unk> as if the <unk> victims was intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also claim that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened and they prescribe their lives joyful and joyful lives like <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence and very typical of domestic violence.
I became <unk> with a cute man and kind of like that three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to have ever more, I would ever have ever more, is a severe gun pointing to my head in the hands of someone who says I will.
At this moment, you are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what stupid you did, but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or that they were being <unk> they are themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, her sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to end up with my crazy love, particularly breaking the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> is only in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply threw light on it.
The victims we need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They were looking at the abuse of the light by talking about it with their children, their colleagues and family and family.
<unk> his vision of survivors like fantastic people as fantastic people who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down your climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our beds, our tables and our family and our families in the oasis and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be accurate for 10 years now.
And I feel like at this moment, there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have gotten dressed up like this.  Luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothes on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women were <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to do it now, but we find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These dentists are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to go through this sweater, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this photo, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer told me that he would raise my back and give him the child's hair.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one I made two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our look, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, to be brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a <unk> way.
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
And I always say, <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what's this <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we have not just defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we have also associated with a high and <unk> shape, and to a white skin.
And that's my <unk> <unk> that I've known to use to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now shown -- and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> Hold on. There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk>
First of all, we need them to know how much of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York City said all and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models just <unk> it is, less than four percent, they were not white ...
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when it is <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know.
But afterwards, what I really would tell you about each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon and a surgeon and the poet <unk> and I would be awesome, because you are the first.
If I was after this spectacular list, No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I am not in charge of all, and you could be the head of <unk> American journal <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
And sadly, once you have your studies, and you have a show and you have a few jobs on your backs, no matter what you're going to say -- if you want to be president of the United States, but you might have a gesture of clothing inside for 10 years, people would look at you.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yeah, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was told, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're entering the personal ground, but it was a girl.
This is how I was looking at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a <unk> party a few days before the first French <unk>
Here's my football team, and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize I'm not me in those photos.
They are creations of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is to do things for free?
I have too many two-inch heel. I have to use, except the <unk> except the privilege I get to are the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to speak.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I went to a store and I forgot to get a shop and I forgot to get the dress in free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped into a red light and, of course, we <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent to be able to <unk>
<unk> of these privilege -- I think, not because I am. And there are people who are paying a price for how no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and the past year of the teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent were black and Latino <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black men in New York City, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
It's about how many times I get <unk>
When I looked at this talk for this talk, I found out that by 53 percent of the age of 13 girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure rises to 78 percent at the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you hope is if you're a little thinner and you have the most bright hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you can get it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative people, clever and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with a smaller legs and the most bright hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs and their clothes more <unk> and the way they are probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to look at a situation of racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something that will hold out of this talk, I hope that everybody will feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in perception of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was enough enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures -- and I didn't go to my <unk>
There was no <unk> or no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum of <unk>
In fact, most of the <unk> tourists at random.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me up this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the <unk> corner.
He gave the chance we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists that they were going to get to the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This is a picture of a few weeks after <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what it had happened that day as a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than <unk> of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time on a week of October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because even though we take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through their eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking around, when all of a sudden he stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the grocery store that <unk> from small to previous <unk>
And he described to me what felt like five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what he looks at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many family pictures.
I'm always the picture coming out there.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and I didn't go on to someone and ask him, and then you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most famous birds group.
First of all, why are they so bad <unk>
It also has been associated with Disney laughs as dumb characters -- stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press and laughter, they <unk> and <unk> these are the attributes that I associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept.
Don't accept. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far away from <unk>  And -- and my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World which are mainly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World World, where we have 16 species of these 16, who are faced with a high risk of extinction.
So, why are the <unk> are important, first of all, they provide vital ecological services for <unk>
It's our <unk> of natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the cadavers up to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria help to absorb anthrax than not being caused by them <unk> and causing huge losses from livestock and disease into other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> individuals take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the High and <unk>
In the mythology -- <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they do a few very important <unk> <unk> in places like Tibet, -- there is no place to bury the dead or wood for <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are on the extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical <unk> and it means that in less than 10 or 15 years, and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned by veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Since there are no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs dogs -- you have a huge <unk> for <unk> The number of life has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be the top of the Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to birds.
They're <unk> of birds.
In Western Africa, there is a terrible trade trade from <unk> to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so you can focus on a business problem that is not going to do anything.
We need to work with governments at <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? Can you write a letter to your government and tell you we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors about <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that changed the opinion of it, because he saw them flying without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be a lot more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything that I do is that I make my life <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
<unk> to <unk> <unk> young people -- but I don't am.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa Rica in <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We were going to be aware of the 21, that Italians were good people and we were doing a good job in Africa.
And instead of that, everything we would have <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to growing food.
So, we got with seeds <unk> south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that goes down to the <unk> River, and we teach local people growing tomatoes and Italians and <unk>
And of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so I would give them to come to work, and sometimes they were going to come to work, and sometimes they were not going to do --  we were aware that the local <unk> in such fertile valley, had not had agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't get to do anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here."
And of course, everything in Africa was grown up.
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red and red at night -- 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate it.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."
I thought that only did the Italians -- mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what they were doing the Americans, what they did the English and after seeing what they were doing, I was quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist, <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, countries -- Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
Just read their book.
<unk> part of an African woman that we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people only two things: or the <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture like my kids, "I want you to have a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture like my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face, "The little <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a stick on the ground and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided at the age of 27 to the people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start nothing, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and it sits with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a coffee. We met a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We became friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what do you do?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find the knowledge of knowledge because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not not, for once, but not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with their <unk>
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what an opportunity have <unk>
So, planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they're not attending their public meetings.
What do we do? We do one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor in the company, the family doctor of the business, who sets up with you in his house, on the kitchen table, and that helps him find the resources to transform his passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this condescending junk that we came to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And so I came up with it.  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> said, "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and a company of company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the corporate spirit.
So now we have <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people want to do with their own money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you for you, privacy, it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then they will come in mass <unk>
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What are you going to talk about is this tomorrow?
Local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossils of fossils -- <unk> <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how we have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a fantastic story that in a futuristic magazine -- many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the <unk> year, they met this group of people -- and they were <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> --  therefore, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States emerged by <unk> companies.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in places like this.
<unk> Michigan.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give you a <unk>
Otherwise they will not come to talk to you.
Then you have to give you a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then later you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the biggest company, the biggest company, has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell is to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic marketing and you have to tell you with a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can be done, selling and search for the money.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 companies icons of the Carnegie <unk> <unk> Company, Ford, all new companies -- Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None of them was started by one person.
It would never tell you about it, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it started.
Nobody begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of small businesses in bars in bars and their dedicated grasslands, who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who speaks to this <unk> someone who will ask you, what need you need?
What can you? Can you do it?
OK, can you <unk> Can you look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
The people around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't really go to a lot of knowledge -- even though sharing public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much they pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and request more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect on our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds a relief with the giant giants that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always gives <unk> the music.  There is a show in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful features in the world, but also one with the most many U.S. <unk>
I live close to this house and I thought how it could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, he lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
Their death was sudden and he was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and so on.
And this led to me a deep gratitude for the life and the life of life.
It gave it clarity to the significant things of my current life.
But I would try to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old old friends and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and painted about her phrases and she said, "Before she die <unk>
So, <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what this experiment was, but the next day the wall was full and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before she died, I want to be <unk> by <unk>  "Before I die I want to sit down to <unk> at the line of <unk>
Before she died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before she died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before she died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before he died, I want to give you one more time.
Before she died, I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the dreams and the hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> This is about giving <unk> and <unk> and to remember what the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues at the civic center we did a kit, and now they've made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era, it was more important than ever before, to find the ways to preserve the ways to keep the perspective and remember that life is brief and fragile.
And death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that they prepare for death is one of those things that we get more power.
Do you think about the death of life -- our life.
Our spaces shared can reflect better what matters as individuals and as a community and with more media to share hope, fear and stories, people around us are not only able to help improve places, it can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single petition.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> has 22 and very <unk>
You don't speak, but it gives you joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> happens what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and notice in this: it's never <unk>
When I singing our childhood, the songs of our childhood, trying to speak the words that I didn't even believe -- it reminds me of one thing -- how little we know about the mind and how wonderful we know should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high. It's very <unk>
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year in which I went out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, you would get my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady birthday.
It doesn't seem amazing?
But most people agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of society, often are <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though you wouldn't consider them inside of it, that could only mean one thing -- that were autistic and autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those least familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder affecting social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself differently, from there that will be so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is to be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster increases in the world, there's no cause or cure <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new thing in my life.
When a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting cars in row around the room, stare at the machine and eat anything that would have <unk>
As I grew up, it would come back differently, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure <unk> nature, a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, when I would wish that they were just like me.
But I look back things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> happens to the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> a single thing to <unk> and to Sam and you might not have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Each of us has a gift on its inner and, honestly, the pursuit of normal, is the ultimate <unk>
The opportunity for <unk> the progress and the change dies at the time we try to be like others.
Please. Don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what has been to be <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communication teacher to give a class of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> of these students with their great minds, their great books and their great unknown books.
But the beginning of those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
So I felt like I had these conversations with the students, and I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to that door is a big communication.
We need a lot of communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the environment and health care environment, and if we don't know we understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as scientists not to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please do it with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and so what?
So why is science relevant to us.
You don't tell us just that we study the <unk> but study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing as they do <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without compromise ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- and they're ways of getting <unk> with their content.
And when I present his work, forget the signs of <unk>
So you have asked why they're called <unk>  What do they do <unk>
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it supports too much in the area of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> Tower, the <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you can provide graphics that will bring our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what it is <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help everybody else open the door and see the country of the wonders that science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, all of the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all of the Oxford Oxford Oxford is <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an Indian editor in the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that you find a public charge -- no matter -- and that when she <unk> you get it through the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what <unk> means.
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the <unk> the exact words they were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who confronted the <unk>
He was brought in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had a popular support in London that won.
And only a few years later we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> as well as the <unk> <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to actually show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to tackle the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might have been <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the United States of the United States <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about <unk>
And they were not even <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given time.
And I could have <unk>
Everyone got tired of <unk> because this debate would be done for three weeks.
And I read the journal of a poor <unk> and always <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to become <unk>
They didn't want to call it King for whether he gave him or his <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the <unk> <unk> more <unk> and more <unk> than they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. Not invented the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I had no more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate was <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would you take a serious degree of <unk> and <unk> as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite thing to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> the headline of President.
President Barack Obama has enough to go out there, waiting for the Senate to <unk>
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk> --  <unk> possible that we are waiting for <unk> years more.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important, and with this, I want to warn you, is that the President of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to disposal, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of aerial motor vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story have laced the title of <unk>
So he won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, appearance of <unk> well, it was a <unk> then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because nobody is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that is the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do with <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, we change much more the words that what they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet under a illegal mine.
The air is <unk> and dust <unk> and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that are talking about but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> <unk> and stones with the primitive.
Like others, I carry a cheap flashlight of light -- he holds her head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that falls hundreds of feet on the ground.
And I would put up my hand and suddenly I remember a coal that I met days earlier, who lost control and fell 1,000 feet into that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep at that hole and their lives without paid a reward and often dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the G8 of Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not to such a grade.
When we ended up talking to me, I was very sad, I was thinking, I was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
It became a <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these sites.
Some of them would even think about my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much as the number of Africans displaced throughout all the love of <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of a <unk> of <unk>
However, you can enslaving entire families for generations for <unk> debt <unk>
Amazingly, slavery brings over <unk> dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then discover that they are forced to work without paying them under a threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but the ones that produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost everyone and yet, it's illegal in all the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show and nanny was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, entire families -- <unk> in a heavy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks in their heads, to 18 at the same time, and they take them from <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task, and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no day to eat, nor to drink, and the severe <unk> made that it was pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera was too hot and <unk> and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run into the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a better treatment better than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> not <unk> Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put it in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his release and trusted that he <unk> it.
As soon as I was waiting to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children dragging stones for miles of <unk> <unk> to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who stood up and children <unk> them to their heads <unk> made of <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
You have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had completely their houses.
When you hear the word slavery we often think of sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness told me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was inspired by women who had been previously <unk>
I was led by a stairs <unk> that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> light <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> like this is known in craft, they are local for prostitution to be <unk>
They have small rooms, private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of the only seven years -- they're forced to the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their customers.
On the <unk> I remember having a sense of <unk> <unk> fear of <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that <unk>
I just had a <unk> the stairs where he <unk>
There was no <unk> doors.
There were no big windows to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because you touch a <unk> subject, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual traffic is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people who are <unk> in agriculture in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 Americans are sold every year as sex sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles are another activity that often relate to the <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages where there was entire families that had lived in the trade of silk.
This is a family.
The black hands of black are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk into the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me his stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, being able to go out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay us to our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to a quick look at fast.
I saw what seemed to be an fishermen family in a boat, two older siblings -- some more young kids have felt about, right?
<unk> were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families <unk> <unk> and they forced working to <unk> extensive in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up there was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of the trees in the <unk> lake is often going to catch networks and children, and <unk> and fear is thrown into the water to unleash the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
By fear of his love is not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they took the last networks, but they had been working on the way that we have been working on.
<unk> and <unk>
And I can point out that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter in which we had the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes possible.
Who will become because of someone decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> partners the <unk> a partner <unk> with their <unk> suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and played the window.
They asked us to do it by a land road to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we got to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out.
Then he pointed out this path barely and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
And as we started down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking about an hour we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as I put in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path, I ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied to their backs and as they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many of them had been under Earth for 72 hours.
They have to put them down to 90 feet and these people carry up with a heavy heavy stone bags that then they will be shipped to another area where they put the stone to get the gold.
The site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer at it, we see them working at least lucky men and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and the <unk> of mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died his uncle took him to work with him in the mines.
When he died their uncle, <unk> I put it the debt of the uncle to be a slave in the mines.
When I met her, I had worked in mines 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so strongly that the doctors were saying that it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, about that, it's forced to work and day on that mine.
Even so, he dream with being liberated and educated and local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in the face of a remote, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on the slavery.
Did you know your images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give us testimony to them and we're going to make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can look at other as human beings, then it makes it very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. These are people, real people, like you, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that happens that I don't think about these so many beautiful people, I think I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force in which you can see them in people like you, and I hope that force change a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
So I make math applied and there is a peculiar problem for whom <unk> are like the management markets.
Nobody knows what the heck we do.
So today I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the dance dancers --  that we'll see later on.
But the ballet training is a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill and probably some initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability to do with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a virtuous dancer <unk>
In the last few years, it's a lot of progress in the course of treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a moral <unk> <unk> stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we're going to know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective metric and a <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's Parkinson's and other disorders of movement there are not biological <unk> so they don't have the blood analysis and the best thing we have is a <unk> neurological test.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of clinical trials, they never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
So that would save a <unk> journey to the clinic. What if patients could be done by <unk>
It doesn't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is that what I want to do is like not conventional to try, you see, in some sense at least we all are <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vibrating strings.
It shows someone healthy while it makes sounds when it makes sounds when you speak, and we can figure out how to coordinate all these vocal organs in order to produce sounds and we all have the genes needed. The <unk> for example.
And as <unk> requires an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about time that takes a child to learn to speak.
So from sound, we can track the position of the vocal strings as they are, and as the Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
In the trace of the bottom here, you can see an example of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of symptoms.
How do you compare these exams in the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They both are <unk> OK, but in addition to <unk> exams are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds a lot.
They're low cost, and we all know what happens here.
When something takes a cost of <unk> it appears at a massive scale.
These are some amazing lists for <unk>
We can reduce the patients in the patients.
You wouldn't have to go to the clinic for routine. <unk>
With <unk> <unk> we could get goals.
We could do this <unk> massive cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at the overall scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when we're going to give you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk> Initiative.
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have affordable lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or Parkinson's disease, it can call under the price and let recordings of a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So you know, <unk> taking all of these samples of, let's say, 10,000 people, you'll be able to say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether or not the organic disease.
<unk> You can see, some people may not be <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion factors in pursuit of the actual markers of disease.
TR: Do you have a <unk> accuracy at this moment?
A lot more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job and now has been shown that it works in the mobile phone network, which is also, what we do is we have one 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's improvement.
<unk> of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were focusing on the dark in rooms and no windows and then we avoid the solar light.
We do those thin models still more <unk> the perfect skin of the whole time, and we would engage in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years of experience and a real taste of the imagery and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my home, just like the rest of the world, the events that were happening in Japan.
Soon as long after, an organization where I was voluntary -- there was a <unk> -- there was a place in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13. I went to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> of <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by wave <unk>
The water level recorded was over 24 feet tall and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
It took away from the canals and the <unk>
<unk> schools. We removed the mud and we left the ready houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, the volunteers had similar things like the neighbors -- they found similar things.
They found pictures and photos of photos and cameras and cards and cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of villages around the way to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a center of the people.
It helped clean the <unk> bathrooms -- huge <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the people where the <unk> center the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
And this was exciting and inspirational I had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went beyond my horizons that something happened.
And when you look at the pictures, I found some that had over a hundred years, some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking like <unk> how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night I walked into Facebook rose with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too much <unk> but where the water had been <unk> the little girl had had a lot of accuracy and <unk>
In another way, that little little girl wouldn't have the next aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time, they came up with a step of time, and it took more <unk> so it was back again on Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people were offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a village to the north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the <unk> libraries that had <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depends on the <unk> of the photos.
It could be one hour. It could be a few weeks.
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw in pretty much hand using a guide of the areas that color and detail there was no <unk>
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures burned in the water <unk> covered in bacteria, even with the oil -- all of it along the time I carry on the time I continue to <unk> it was a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford this picture unless he was clean down, dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We had luck with <unk>
We have the <unk> of a <unk>
It's very easy to hurt even more the pictures already <unk>
As he said once he said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky to the photos.
He had started <unk> she was stopped to realize that it was even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been <unk> we were able to get the images in a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When they picked up their photos shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble very far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave of <unk>
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their little children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
It took a week to find all his family and knowing that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her pictures of his little child for 14 years.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift that he could read to look, something that he could remember from the past that I had not been marked on the last day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there -- hundreds of them were helped to clean up with <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the great majority went back to the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families hundreds of photos and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 <unk> teams and materials, most of the ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, someone loved.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would take to look for it to look for.
So this was what the project was trying to restore little bits of humanity, to bring back to someone with the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that is given.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger and put something, using their talent for something that is not being models of perfect skin.
To finish my email. I would like to read this electronic email -- I emailed it back the day from Japan after six months.
As <unk> I couldn't avoid thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular one, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the little girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all the very few basic needs are themselves, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on an exhibition of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion a second.
I present to you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create a slow motion of light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> of the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and is really challenging the camera.
So if I take a laser pointer and it turned it into a <unk> of second or a number of <unk> to create a pack of photons -- just a millimeter of <unk>
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet does.
If we took that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do those photons disperse inside this <unk>
What is what the light looks like.
Now, all of this --  Remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light movement.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a pack of photons that starts to <unk> and inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it's going to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons are finally coming into the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
In that time, waves travel down the table, and because of the insights on the top of the bottle, it looks at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the <unk> <unk>
Now, if we take a bullet and current bullet and we make it go down the same distance and we see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much you think they would take us sit down to see that movie?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film --  from a slow bullet in motion.
What about how about testing nature <unk>
You can see the waves that were <unk> from the table, and the <unk> wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a photo, I was like, like, a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at the more time, you realize that, as the light comes out of your <unk> it's <unk>
Why? Because the tomato <unk> and the light bounces inside its inner and it goes back to a number of <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera in MIT? MIT?
As photographers already -- you know, if you take a photo in the <unk> it goes very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest show -- so I'll just get some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded one and again with very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and really interesting ways.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow you to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw a little bit of light on the door. You get to the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and then the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, in a slightly different time.
And as we have a camera that works that fast, our <unk> has unique skills.
It has very good resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances all the way up to the door and also even the hidden objects but we don't know what it corresponds to that distance.
When you project a laser to record a photograph, you can record a picture that you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we look at it in <unk>
This is our reconstruction <unk>
We have things for exploring before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> collisions with what's around the curve, the curve.
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions looking at light reflected through the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new modality of visualization to solve the problems of <unk> health in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself was a scientist, I turned science in art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect is not just for scientific visualization, but we can see that we can see that we can be able to collect it.
We create a new form of computer photography with a slow motion and <unk>
And look at those waves -- remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here is also a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> you go ahead of us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects. Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order that events happen in the world sometimes appears to the camera.
We have the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile can <unk> life, and gives you an individual freedom.
A mobile phone can be <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With mobile phones can be tweet a message and initiate a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and you get it to get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> from 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are <unk> in search of change.
So this is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they were looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who should have a phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone, <unk>
<unk> A Blackberry, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot of people today have a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and what changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> data lines.
It's in gross.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. hit a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every single telephone company, every single Internet provider has to store a wide range of user information.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to who.
Who sends a text in <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company, or the Internet company.
And all of Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone to and the Internet providers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> Vietnam.
<unk> was the secret police of East Asia.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who then was the largest telephone company in Germany, that please give me all the information that they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to the question, and I didn't get a concrete answer -- it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to make a criminal demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give this information.
At the end, I <unk>
We would get the demand and they would send me the information that I would have.
Meanwhile, the <unk> tribunal failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown on a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
At first, I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge archive. OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data means.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and <unk>
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom back and go forward.
You can see every step I make.
And you can see what I'm going to do with <unk> <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talked about a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then one calls to the other, and then we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate to each other, what time they call each other, what hour to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to who, who you send an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, neither is the fall of <unk>
Because today, state agencies today want to store so much information from us as possible inside and outside the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives, and they want to keep it forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you turn home to your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value, and it's not <unk>
When you go home, we will encourage your representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, <unk> what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, <unk> what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
I encourage my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result of a result, I have cerebral palsy, so I would take it all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> C is not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, although they are.
It's only about accidents, like the one that happened at the birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of them to be there.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish I will be disabled
Let's go <unk>
At Christmas, you're in the mall, and they drive in circles in search of parking lot, and what do you see?
16 empty places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I say, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There will be a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim disabled and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same time.
I also love that if I'd like to walk from my house to New York City, I can.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you help me?" <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters were <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents went to the school system, and they were <unk> that I was also out there, and if we didn't take all the top note -- all the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five years putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used to be hang out a dollar in front of me to make it <unk>
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong and and and and ...
Yeah. The first day in kindergarten was walking as a joke champion that has received a lot of taps.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were every family.
Now there's 20 Arab now, and they're still every family --  I think no one realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as <unk>
People who grew up had no problems with my faith.
But it seemed to be a lot like a lot of hunger in the <unk>
I would tell you that he had enough fat to live three months without eating without eating it, so <unk> at dawn is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy so they sent me to school dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was coming.
I spent my summers on a war zone, because my parents were worried that if we didn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we had to become <unk>
On a summer holiday I was often trying to <unk> so I was drinking <unk> and I was drinking glasses of <unk> and he got me dressed in the back, and I was blown away in the <unk> Sea and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say that it's very boring, but before I make yoga was a <unk> comedy that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can turn it into your head.
My parents would argue, this idea that I could do anything, that any dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college by the positive discrimination and I got a grant for the University of Arizona, because I walked into all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> of the theater.
And I will all love me.
I made all the tasks of the least smart, I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo my <unk> teachers.
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started shout at the four <unk> <unk> I finally have a <unk>
I have paralysis <unk>
At the end of it <unk>
Thank God <unk> at the end of my <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk>
I went to <unk> running to the head of the theater of theater, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask him why and she told me that because they believed it couldn't make the venture scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that literally was born and they gave an actor without cerebral <unk>
The college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors with no disabled papers.
And I went back home, and my first tour, <unk> was as an extra thing in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew that it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, he stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the <unk> <unk> didn't have no white, <unk>
It's just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I became <unk>
In my first tour, I took comics famous from New York City to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first note that he took when she was going to high speed on the New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in <unk> across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that they never heard that little nasty rumor that women are not fun, and they are very fun.
In 2003, my brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York City, now in her 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in media and to remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs was much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma for the <unk>
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I went as invited to the <unk> news program behind Keith <unk>
I walked as if I was at a graduate dance, I went to a study and they sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I tied up at the desk desk for not getting out of the screen during the <unk> and when the interview, I was <unk>
I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they would not come back.
But not only Mr. <unk> came back to <unk> but I was just like the <unk> and hit my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
The kids are told that kids are <unk> but I never had a little girl or no more.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became a <unk> object.
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It is <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist <unk>
What do you have?
We should really pray for it.
One guy suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then <unk> you can't do someone in a wheelchair.
The disabled are the -- yeah, <unk> man. Come on.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying that I don't get <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with the media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that <unk> less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need every society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the amazing Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the children refugee refugee -- a little bit of what my parents told me.
It was the only time my father saw me working on live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a little South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> drives the little village to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there's no work there -- there is no work, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year ago, nothing.
One day he gets about a guy who offers him to <unk> after dinner, <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives a break.
She gets a little bit of money so you bought new clothes, money to send home to your family.
They present to a young lady.
They finally got home.
It starts a new life.
He's got a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a bomb car.
That little kid in that little town with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist -- and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> <unk> organization with al Qaeda.
So, how the story of a little boy is trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that came.
This was the first thing that got him out of what we call the <unk> <unk>
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban <unk> riots in London, riots in London, which are looking for something beyond <unk> <unk>
For the young people, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of opportunity, of well-being, but the young people not participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if they didn't give them opportunities, the history of <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to the violence, to the <unk> will be the story of urban cities.
And in my hometown of birth, it <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They don't do pretty much anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember standing in front of that hospital <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had seen forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support a lot of youth leaders in a business.
<unk> to a few 90 leaders who are <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me that because he was a college college student, <unk> frustrated, I was the perfect white white for <unk> and other organizations terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to the B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have been completely destroyed the road system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a company to <unk>
He started <unk> motorcycles to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of motorcycles for the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit -- and I believe that corporate spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so <unk>
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who went to one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was reluctant to train some of the young people at the height of the business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic sent from the overseas.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> design and design.
I created a farm in the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers to spouse and creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies are now working on the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where families, young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO to work for the government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they might be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the major challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people and creating a culture of corporate spirit is really a big step, but the young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need to experience and orientation and <unk> in the development of their business.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from conception to creation, and they will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the corporate spirit is something more than start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park of <unk> this is how it is called, when it is created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the bikes for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape paralysis of the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, they will become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks than <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> a <unk> area in the north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and it will not be on the way that we <unk> we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We arrived at our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful <unk> lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four feet with the hearts of apple <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And he was <unk> he was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> that were too lazy to pull out what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where <unk> <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> <unk> our trash, of 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> and every single day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
And I traveled in the trucks and she walked through the streets, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a lot more to go further.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks.
And operated the mechanical <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody wonders about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong is rapidly <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies kept pushing into the weight of getting over their tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and coming into the traffic all day and pass across around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And also, the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of garbage.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is as a force of nature itself.
Never stop coming.
It's also like a breathing form or circulation.
It always must be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste and effective and effective way every day, this begins to <unk> their container and their dangers inherent us threaten in very real ways.
So we had controlled for decades and centuries come back and start to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing -- we don't have space for what the engines of economy begin to fail when it's endangered percent.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointing his relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed necessary.
This is what I mean by just the speed that we used to move in the <unk>
We usually don't get <unk> and we cleaned up with us our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, we forget about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side that will take away from it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the collection of waste that perhaps help reduce stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keeps us apart from ourselves, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow is always because of one way or another.
One day after September 2001, I heard the <unk> of a <unk> collection truck in the street, grabbed my little baby collection and went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you to do her work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "Let's be fine.
Let's be OK."
Soon after that I started looking at the collection of waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that I was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have to include and have to account all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor.
<unk> <unk> what we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic of memories.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose job is to clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is born from the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both of projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives are becoming an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a <unk> mall in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Addis
This is the kind of building that showed us as example, to my team and to me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because of the <unk> <unk> it generates heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this should not happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And thirdly, what it looks like is nothing to do with Africa and in Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> being a rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, he was actually greeted by the old market that is this structure of open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern <unk> of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge came to the survey the site, which is located in a much growth area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we see now in the image, not yet.
And in addition to two parallel streets that they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was we create a connection between these two streets, joining all the inputs of the building.
And this spreads up with a <unk> <unk> that creates a space to open air in the building that would spread through its own way of sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the space form.
And I also thought, how to close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that <unk> local weather conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue similar to a <unk> <unk> with <unk> to allow the air air and also from the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use light from the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping mall.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the commercial center because it was more profitable to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was so much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy energy for the building in a city where the electricity is short almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting up <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which together collect water for the <unk>
You wait for the early year, because we're going through the fifth floor of the construction floor.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a project that's so big, the bigger that I should have designed -- I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, and their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve access doors with almost straight.
When I went to place, the first design operation we did was to expand existing streets and creating 12 initial blocks similar to the size and the ones that are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we choose a few points for the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this change the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation,
So we had a schematic that claims that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local rules that set up a greater density at higher levels and a lower density on the ground floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as giving the community to the community occupied with building construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can climb up and <unk> and make activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from a building to another building.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same rate that buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had very bright hair lots of very bright hair, and a little <unk> of <unk> <unk> it was very strong for <unk> of states, very good for <unk>
And I finished that year and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I got a time after the <unk> I was a bit late and I hid in the <unk> bathroom, I was a little bit evening.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I went into the classroom, I took off the table of my master's book <unk>
And then I did.
I would take the ratings out of my <unk> just a little bit, just some of those.
All the way --  And I set myself back to the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other peers had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> we would get the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all rows of <unk> and myself just a row of them, just because of being there, because <unk>
I'm still surprised by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never got paid.
It's that everything was obvious <unk>
I will never tell me.
But most of all, I got rid of the reason why I was bothered by that this little girl, so small was so good to <unk>
I am <unk>
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
And also the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that will take us loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab in which they study the <unk> in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know whether it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no foie <unk> I would have no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> <unk> or <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
There is no Shakespeare.
<unk> the high school lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, most of them all of them.
This year, it was 100 years of their work <unk> "In pursuit of the time -- the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> and the whole thing we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details, right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how the relentless it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat, <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they're going so well together, the novel and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, who are reduced to the person, to their desire, their <unk> are a good narrative base -- <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel once, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
So being the storytellers and the audience, we know exactly what details <unk> to nail the <unk> right?
<unk> are doing all of <unk> <unk> and that is something that I chose understand.
All that she does to give me pleasure could give it pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool thing that <unk> detects in his lover -- adds to his collection of instruments of torture in his private chamber.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the great amounts of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> get rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram is as successful --  -- <unk> links the language of <unk> with jealousy.
When you <unk> it is in his agony of jealousy, day, you suddenly hear behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of their lover -- then appropriately, those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or to look at a <unk>
He says, "It's <unk> scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're finding some knowledge of knowledge, search of truth, a really painful truth -- in fact, to what it was going to do, the more painful truth, the best <unk>
The pain, the <unk> -- these were the pathways towards the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to make us feel -- that drives us with us a much deeper and deeper feelings that a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that let's go for <unk> women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way?
There's some other excitement to us, our terrible, horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other excitement that teaches us to look at the intensity of <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was being consumed with the idea that his wife was <unk>
And Freud says there was a little weird thing in that man, not <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he was doing his wife, without realizing behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> with one man?
Freud says the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
The novels will describe very well how we get them to look at the intensity but no precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, we are more we became residents in fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the <unk> are taking us to make violent acts or illegal acts.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself -- I am thinking about the <unk> but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
One woman of Michigan was captured by 52 years of age was captured by having created a false Twitter account from the one that was sent to the messages that were horrible messages to itself, for a year.
A year -- every year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of his former former boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How large, even though you get creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel of Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who try to tell the jealousy, <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, viruses, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to get to the <unk> of your being and <unk> from what you ever <unk> and is under the <unk> and it takes your <unk> cow bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in the time of envy.
We live at times of jealousy.
That is, we are good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what characters always do when you're not sure, when you're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always got <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> rat <unk> which needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius.
Oh, it sounds like <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually in "The <unk> of six <unk> and eventually in "The <unk> <unk> <unk> to all of your solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there's no person in <unk> <unk> that I don't want to raise your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I find this very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat them as a geometry, a geometry, geometry, <unk> problem.
You know, in a <unk> minute, it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute, they're the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being him <unk>
It could still be that easy?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Only fiction <unk>
The fiction used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the terrifying terrifying Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in a great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21 of 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Dead Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, they were alone, but their presence on the <unk> surface was the culmination of a collective <unk>
The Apollo program was the biggest incidence of peace in American history.
To get to the Moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
<unk> gave work to about 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 people, and universities and universities and government agencies.
They died people, including the Apollo crew <unk>
But before the Apollo program, 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, which was Aldrin after Armstrong was <unk> last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> 15 pounds of rocks, rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because the Kennedy president wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had best rockets.
But the English words at the University of Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask why the <unk>
Why do we turn it into our goal?
And they might also ask, why would you scale the most <unk>
Thirty-five years ago, why do you fly about <unk>
Why do I play Rice <unk>
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> before the powers of technology.
They were because it was something great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a kind of a long list of technological intuition.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and the smallpox.
Technology seemed like what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we could not go faster than a horse, or a sailing ship, but in 1969, the Apollo crew crew flew 40,000 miles per hour.
Since 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo crew 10, and the optimism joyful about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems that we imagine that technology would solve as to go to Mars, create clean energy, curing cancer, or feeding the world population seem to have been <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
And I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the <unk> <unk> tube from the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew about this would be the last mission, but I was completely sure that I would get to see colonies on Mars.
So it occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard this for the last two days here at TED.
It seems as though the technologists would have met us, and we would have adapted with trivial, and things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up selling it.
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But I don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that you have been created less ambitious companies that are <unk> Intel and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the investment of risk led to <unk> the creation of ideas that are driven by the funding of <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly is going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their peak point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investments, it's a total investment that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always been problems to invest with the benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and that development is in the long term. They have never invested in the development of technologies dedicated to solving big problems because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA's even designed a plan.
But go to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We will not go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things that do on Earth.
Sometimes, we cannot solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from sources of renewable energy like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and the oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want some sources of alternative energy that can compete in the price.
Now, technologists, technologists, the economists and economists agree about what politics and international treaties -- the development of an effective increase in research and development development, and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an energy policy of the U.S. or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technology, turn out not to be.
We know from time ago that famines are result in the food <unk>
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and <unk> but there will be famines as bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The Nixon Nixon declared war to cancer in 1971, but soon we found that there are many types of cancer -- some <unk> <unk> to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The difficult problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we need to have -- but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must really be a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
<unk> mission has become something like this as a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve great problems, it serves with those bill.
But it's a model model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there's no popular science of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was only three days.
And actually, I was not even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decrease of trust, it's a very general belief process.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should get the trust.
I think <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions and that might have increased others.
I don't have of sure.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are the source of the belief that trust has <unk>
When you look at opinion polls over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, they are still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But this is enough?
What polls record are, of course, views.
What else can you get?
What you see is the attitudes attitudes that people think is when you get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
You probably want to ask, "What do you do?
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some <unk> but in other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel by a given kind of <unk> the official or a person is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain teacher teacher I know to give you the classroom, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my <unk> <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we let all of that knowledge when we think about trust as we think about trust form.
I believe that surveys are very bad tools to measure the real real confidence -- because they try to engage the good inherent judgment in fact that trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I was doing.
I would encourage you to have more trust in terms of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I am a <unk> of not trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who have <unk> their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say it, he says, yes, it means that what matters in the first place is not the trust, but the trustworthiness.
What is about making a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but I didn't try to get a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they would have their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're doing, we are talking about before trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, professional officials and so forth, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
And I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the vacant <unk> that I'm going to attend <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we found that the delivery system that is destined to ensure the <unk> and the testing tests actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You've got all of you know the similar examples.
They were doing all of that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different from being worthy of trust and giving it to the people who are reliable and if we want to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the simple actions -- simple actions.
Third, the task.
You go to the task rebuild the trust, puts things into the other way.
It suggests that you and I should have the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately, it's kind of signature because other people are.
You can't rebuild what other people have ever given.
You have to give them the foundations enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> all of the people, all the time.
But you also have to bring some <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is a day that makes a whole day, the ordinary people, the <unk> the institutions, very well.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks -- he says I can <unk> it without giving us explanations.
I carry them up and get the money, or they change the color of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a really good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not really hard to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers we've become <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone to become more and more and more and more, at a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everybody.
But I ask you, and if there was no <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
So first I created this tool that comes up in digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers their physical body into the pixel again.
The designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organ under the screen.
So with this tool is break the barriers.
But the two hands remain still on the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of your hands?
In the division of Science <unk> from Microsoft, with my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
<unk> a transparent bombsight with deep cameras to detect your fingers and face, now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and the files have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy as to grab a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and you can highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that are down on every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
We would have a lot of us will be bought and <unk> things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device in the head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in the space, how can we make physical physicists so that we can get them back and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my <unk> <unk> Post, we created this single physical <unk>
This magnet, <unk> is behaving as a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as the users can move the object anywhere in this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And by programming the object, we extract it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and distance and distance and the famous <unk> of Michael Jordan, can be reproduce as a physical reality that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike <unk> or text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what is more fascinating than changing the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but that will begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world around us without that we have to <unk> out of our world.
So we started talking about a barrier, but if you took that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
And I became <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk> years.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to <unk> to a school for athletes with all the <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed that there was only a accurate path to <unk> a safe way and <unk>
No matter if the job would like or not.
But my dream was to be an Chinese opera, Chinese House.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
Until I wrote to the director of the school and the head of a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much bigger to train.
My dream will never be <unk>
I think for the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing that I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved for another <unk>
No one to me, wanted to <unk> OK.
I went to books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I got to America in 1995, and what were the first books to do here?
The ones that were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk> life.
And it's not a bold <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said to me, "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave me place to my reading <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
For instance, at the beginning, this map seemed to me outside because this is what students in China learn.
I'd never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people.
read. comparative isn't a new thing.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research camps like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if reading comparative work worked for research, why not do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and duty to <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Instead of losing the translation, found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I alone or <unk> never.
Having a dream that is really not anything compared to what many other have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
The most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology, in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex went into the first session using jeans and a <unk> cover, threw up on the couch, of my office <unk> my shoes and told me he wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like the first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the amazing stories that Alex <unk> to the <unk> became very easy to just move the head while I would get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and so I saw she was right.
You start to work after that, you get home later, she has children later, until death goes next.
For <unk> like Alex and I had time to <unk>
But shortly afterwards, my <unk> <unk> sent me to Alex to talk about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Sure, are coming out with the guys under his category, and it was <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe you get away with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel a head after what they did, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex be a pause in its development.
This made the <unk> of Alex being the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences -- not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes to adulthood.
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yeah. That's amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take your dream off a <unk> I want to see. It's good. <unk> the <unk> matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen at the 35 years.
This means that eight of the 10 decisions and experiences and moments and moments -- that give their life to life that you will have been in order to have 30 and <unk>
People of 40 people are <unk>
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career, have a exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner for 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change themselves, now it's the time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that the female fertility comes up to the top 28, and things become complicated to <unk>
<unk> are the time to get rid of their body and their options.
When we think about the developing child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment where his everyday and common life has a <unk> impact on the person who was <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what people are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes at the line of the <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence of <unk>
journalists asked the <unk> names.
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard Cohen said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and you say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it is absolutely nothing.
And then all of the days, and then all of the days, and then all of the days, you get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not account. I'm just killing the time."
Or they say, "We're all saying that while I'm going to start a career before the 30, everything is right."
But then it begins to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better run, the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, he turned the music and they all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only thing to be standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he was <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme, but you don't know the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there is enormous pressure to 30 and so many of them start a career, choose a city, choose a mate, and have two or three children in a very short period of time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there are some research that start to show you, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything at the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying sports sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want now.
Realizing you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves in the room, and I talk about their <unk> "What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having a identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a few very hard <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
It was often often in our <unk> but then she woke up her to say, "You don't choose your family, but he can choose his friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for nearly the hour.
I had just bought a new book <unk> and I had spent all the morning with a lot of <unk> but then I was watching the empty space that follows after the words in <unk> please call <unk>
I was about to the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if I get to <unk>
At that moment, I had a lot of effort to resist and say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually gets <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit as the decade of Emma was going on.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all of us had a woman, or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that was <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> capital of identity.
By capital capital I mean to do something that would add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital generates capital capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm going to tell you the exploration that I shouldn't have to count, by the way, it's not exploration,
It's <unk>
I told Emma to explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are excellent to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds are limited to who you know, what they know about, how do you think about, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who comes out almost always comes from their nearest circle nearby.
The new things come from what they call weak bonds of friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half isn't -- and the weak links are the shape of <unk> to this group.
Half of the work had never been <unk> then, to meet the head of your neighbor is the way we get a work not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not least important, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> Emma would give her family to her family, when he has a partner and it exists in their own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had arrived.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit in mind that 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person who you live now or do you right now when all Facebook are starting to walk towards the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being so intentional in love as you're in the work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it to work or killing time with anyone who's going to get them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the fellow after a cousin I worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a work there.
That labor supply gave a reason to leave the boyfriend, who live alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married man with a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I send me a letter that said, "Now the emergency room spaces are not <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The <unk> are like airplanes of Los Angeles, who come out to some place in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 or even the <unk> a good conversation, a good job -- a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few generations or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading into all the <unk> that know.
It's as simple as I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege to tell <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get the capital of identity, use their weak ties.
They don't let us define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job <unk> for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to <unk> <unk> in New York City schools.
And as any teacher, I applied testing and tests.
I give them assignments.
When I work back, I will save grades.
What struck me is that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones who had better performance did not have scores of <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way.
And what if you succeed in school in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who <unk>
We went to the National Geographic National <unk> and we tried to predict what children were most far as possible in competition.
We study teachers who are working in really hard cities, and what teachers are still going to be teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the more effective to improve the results of their <unk>
We partnered with private enterprises, asking yourself, which of these marketers are going to keep their <unk> <unk>
And who is going to win more money?
In all of those very different contexts emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health, and it wasn't the <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passionate and <unk> to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have a <unk>
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the week, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to make my sense of determination and then I waited for more than a year to see those who were <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly better <unk> even when they were <unk> them in every characteristic that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the testing <unk> even the safety of the children when they were at school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the <unk> National <unk> that matters <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
To me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know the science about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I develop determination in children?
What should I do to teach kids a <unk> of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, they are commonly related to or related to the measures of talent.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University for <unk> <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and they learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they fail, because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start all over new lessons with the <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreign abroad, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese can be helpful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of each character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and easy way.
A Chinese academic <unk>
You just need a thousand to understand basic meaning.
The first 200 people will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read from <unk> <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of web pages or newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as possible until it's possible to be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
<unk>
If the fire form is a person in both sides as if I was screaming <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> <unk> but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The <unk> symbol looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
They are building blocks so they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two of them are company, three are crowd.
If a person stretch your arms, this person is saying <unk> as big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a prisoner's dilemma as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  -- <unk> of remember, because a speaker is not quite an idiot.
Do you remember the fire?
Two displays, you get very hot.
Three fireworks together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. You put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming up hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together are <unk>
Three of them all together, be careful <unk>
So we've already spent almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing as a Chinese for eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun sitting with the origin, because Japan is east of China.
So one sun next to the origin, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the principal has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I must stop talking and get off the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be a dad is the films I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The <unk> film is for months.
Her favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and bringing a magic wand
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of industrial complex fantasy show.
However, the magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly enough, another movie whose <unk> a metal kid and a <unk> kid would give a girl dressed as a <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the films that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk> magician,
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the magician magician, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
<unk> magic shoes to defeat the <unk> of the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another one thing of the one thing about the magician of Oz is that the most brave characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I saw Star Wars a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also had a son.
For three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had been <unk>  So I was blown away in the room and was struck like a leg leg with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It should be the feeling that Luke one of the Army is a army to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the magician Oz of <unk>
How do you win Dorothy your movie?
They're doing good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to grow up, okay? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much force <unk> force in the movies for our kids, and so little of the road <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's really good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
Now, I know the experience the princess <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that I would have served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first one I was hoping that they started to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is done, I have a girlfriend.
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the <unk> and they get their reward, and they don't hold time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a <unk> animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they were the kids, they're not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job teaching girls how to defend the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war movies.
Of course, the most successful topic of all times continues is in classic in classic after a young boy or a man, or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's available in shops.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that be <unk>
Well, almost none of these films is the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not its roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book comic and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation I had with a friend about the assessment of the films that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> In the movie, there are more of a female character than I should have 3.
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than you like it?  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success, an idea of consensus from what is a Hollywood Hollywood film.
<unk> isn't the test of <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women hide during the crisis of <unk>
We have many scenes from men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's put it in the numbers.
In 2011, in the 100 more popular movies, how many of them believe they have actors.
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage of women that we've chosen recently to Congress, then it's okay.
But there's a bigger number that goes to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's a mass <unk>
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I believe that music or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistician, one of the things that I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you not achieve <unk>
They're <unk> the story of a male hero is to defeat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our willingness as <unk> <unk> and we hope that we would have to ask, but I have to ask, do you have to ask, do you have to ask, if at the same time, it activates or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we need to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of the man is changing radically.
You will have read about how new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite character of Star Wars you know what <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to get them to their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want to think about the stories that I read to my <unk> <unk> and struggle only and more stories where it looked like his work is to join a team -- maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician magician,
Thank you.
I was living in Maine and one of the things that I liked was to look at sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, with time, I would encourage <unk>
I started to see forms and patterns that helped me to <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and the <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles of length along the <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
So to try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
So I want to show you a example of how different the infrared is.
This is a place located in the Eastern delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the spot, it seems like to be brown but when we use infrared infrared and processing it using <unk> suddenly the place looks like bright pink <unk>
What you're seeing are the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used the satellite data to find a <unk> city, called <unk> missing for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Ottoman Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great revival of ancient art <unk> architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere close to the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> in the red circles here, but somewhere within this enormous <unk> <unk>
This area is huge -- it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, it moved into this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
They try to find it randomly would be the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So, we use NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that looks inside the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs you can see here.
When I say <unk> is like the shots of the sample of ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation for us.
Five feet down, underneath a thick thick layer, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of 100 feet down, we have a layer of occupation several hundred years that date out of the Ottoman Empire -- exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs and quartz and <unk> what proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Ottoman Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes from the Roman Empire
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry workshop who shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still didn't find any <unk> here, but we would find the place in a near future for <unk>
Even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology, so they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire was probably written about 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So it looks like TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually started in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts <unk> to <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door <unk>
I'd like to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that is made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> obese <unk>
They are competing in a <unk> career of bicycles and go in the direction of their <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide in front of the door of their house.
There are bikes that are flying around, wheels that go on their side, the top of the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the door, you know.
The lobby, to the hall, or what there is to the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's <unk> with the hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speaks to speech.
You can feel your blue <unk> going to tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you're going to go into the mouth.
They go on a side and enter their living room.
It's already in the room, and making the maximum use of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing on his center <unk> singing <unk> One more <unk> More <unk>
They now go to cooking.
The soil has been coated with a yellow brick path and from the oven, come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and Len was from "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I was to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist -- waiting, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
<unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
We had entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the best order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be the phenomena of nature.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This one is a guy named Ed <unk> who had come from England and he has one of the best memories to <unk>
And I said, "Well, when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some ancient techniques -- invented a couple of years ago in Greece, the same techniques that I used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and that medieval academics used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have no ear of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and bright English and bright one, although a little <unk> said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards at live on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year not only training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He's <unk> very likely to the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window to allow you to see how to point our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> In he based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went on a afternoon together in the Salt Lake City, <unk> guides it was <unk>
And when I came back, I read a number of treaties on memory -- something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of things really interesting.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having disciplined and disciplined memory that was not a thing as rare as it can be today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in delivering their minds.
These techniques have made us possible our modern world, but they've also changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed cognitive too.
As we almost don't have any need to remember, sometimes it seems to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you're still passionate people about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there's a <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a team of researchers at University College University invited a memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to have brains in some way, structural or different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive <unk> and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference and a significant difference between the brains of the memory of memory and the challenges of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a <unk> machine, <unk> their brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in memory champions being poured into parts of the brain, different to others.
They <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive is driving as a armed race in where each year appears to someone with a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of competitors must put a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 percent of cards called <unk> who is about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just him <unk>
He used a <unk> technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there's a huge amount of ways of remembering things in these competence, absolutely all the techniques by the end of you are reduced to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox.
That's his <unk>
And then I'm asking you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship anymore.
With all the other memories they dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have food.
They do well when they come home to work.
Probably some <unk>
And when we took that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some point back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this past half a half thousand years ago in the <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is like this: There was a poet named <unk> I attended a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't get to a <unk> you would get to a <unk>
He stood up, he <unk> his memory poem, and it was as soon as the classroom was, <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed all of us, but it shattered the <unk> <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing out, only surviving in the middle of the rubble, he closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting on each time.
I took the family from the <unk> hand to where their loved ones were on the debris.
What we're going to have noticed at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we are not good to remember names or phone phone numbers, or instructions on the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
So if you ask them that I'm going to tell you the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask them to say who was sitting on the horse <unk> in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of memory palace is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and images of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago to the first memory treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you were invited to the TED stage to give you a talk and you want to do this memory, in the same way that I would have done it <unk> if they were invited to <unk> it 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that they're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous image of an absolutely ridiculous, crazy image to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on <unk>
And that will remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they get in the kitchen, and the room that they spoke to would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help me remember it.
So this is how the <unk> <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not a word that is going to confuse but, typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people were thinking about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this sort of space terms.
The phrase <unk> would be like the first place in his palazzo of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I jumped in with it.
I went to some of these memory plans, and I had the idea of writing a little bit about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> <unk> event.
But seriously, it's like seeing a whole bunch of people sitting on exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of a ancient school dropout in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was a fun thing to do.
I would never have expected to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What it is actually about doing is to do better and more the ability to create and imagine these images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard team of training for memory competition.
This is a couple of <unk> and some of the items of safety covered with <unk> because the distraction.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could actually read in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment was <unk>
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's cute as cute as you memorize and the phone numbers and the phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just <unk> tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize them from <unk> to benefit with a little bit of insights about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, it's not even <unk> really.
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing, sort of complete attention that most of you are not going to be <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
This is how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what you would do, the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is our short <unk> <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who is going to go to our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even care about process <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are amazing memory capacities for all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex subject, so it <unk> only a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Afghanistan, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom as a child.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was an balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all the time looking at television and so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me and I would go back in a towel and I would all look at me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> I hated it.
I took that journey, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that felt, that is the power of architecture -- because architecture is not about mathematics, or a divide of areas, but those connections -- emotional connections that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture is determines in ways that we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would do with you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it by based on a building built two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, far away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is frightening.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that are going to work.
So we met buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library of <unk> which ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he's got a <unk> has this round thing -- columns, brick that leave <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, it ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, two buildings, two buildings, both so-called libraries, be completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> architects that constantly drives new technologies, new new solutions for life forms today.
We will have we <unk> it and we <unk> so far from the people.
Every single black, this tells us you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and come back with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started experimenting with <unk> and we start experimenting with the flip back and forth and over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, I was <unk> from the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Something really hard.
So we zoom in in the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know that we like and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added bake to use new materials.
They love it.
We don't take <unk>
We took <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
One madness.
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the Italian <unk>
It may be a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They are easy, they are cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories from other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated and we started making the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now tell us with new design techniques, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is <unk> and <unk> and it's super <unk> You are totally <unk>
Normally the <unk> <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when academics and public and general public, they were completely aware of a building.
The New York Times journal <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> growth grew up on a half and a half percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first architect star.
But how is it possible that these wild forms, and <unk> how it is possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the means is because the media was around and very quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The major mayors of the world.
So everybody believed if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the beginning of new millennials happened with other architects star.
And I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of new millennium, actually began to happen with all architecture. The digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think of it, for example, how you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
So shipping is <unk> you can take a ship, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in TV, and in TV, and in the end, we're all photographers from architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere now, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It's not very accurate enough to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before I knew if the one who designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we met buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to be going back to be <unk> because we're in the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the <unk> of the steel or the elevator.
So my theory is that when the pendulum applies to media, start to swing faster and faster, until it will be on both extremes of it -- and they <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community, and like the drawings looked like exactly the product done, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people started reaching and shared it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a communication tool, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that one made of the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and to the load of these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other, what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians <unk>
If that building was built today, first <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
They are bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can lead to the mayor of <unk> people and tell them that there's no one answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> public who doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
Architects can listen, and you don't leave it by architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different than the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation historical brick historical brick in ideas that should be a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we're finally going to be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage, and this means that a parking garage in Miami has Florida, it can also serve for sports or to <unk> or even you can get married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East <unk> of New York, and to raise half a million dollars of the community attached to that cause, no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we care is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> buildings more intelligent, more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to them.
Finally, we're not on opposite direction.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give it way to the <unk> spaces -- the local libraries -- the homes where we formed our children, and the <unk> to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned out a year and started walking.
And it makes it very cool from the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
They <unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves these big <unk> and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do it. And he made me think, when's what I couple of doing this?
How is it all of a sudden we're not comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> He's 13 years old, and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, although his mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
Among what your mom tells you and what his friends, or fellow school colleagues say, you don't know who I believe.
So a video of her own, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others for me to leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten more than 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a very normal <unk> and regular <unk> who gets these answers into one of their most vulnerable lives in emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting movies like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it driving to do this?
Well, the teenagers today almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this never ends.
Never before we have been so connected, in a continuous way, so young <unk>
As a mother told me, "It's like a party in his room all <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment will be always connected, it's <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There is no division between a life and the real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is causing digitally.
What is the most prominent thing in the life of someone in front of what it's normal in a day?
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the stories of the girls now.
<unk> of size.
The <unk> technique is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of those who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are comparing to.
But kids are not immune to this.
It's like the golden stars in the sport, and the singers would die.
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, surely we want our kids to grow healthy and be a good individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with image, we are teaching our kids to spend more time and effort to their appearance, to the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities, their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six of 10 girls prefer to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for growth as human beings, and as <unk> to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the debates of class, to participate in the classroom class because they don't want to call attention to their physical things.
One in five are not coming to classroom at all days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the testing season, if you don't think you look at good enough -- you know, if you don't think you're good enough -- you're going to get a note of the average note of your fellow people who don't care about that as appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the U.S. and China.
And it becomes regardless of what these young people actually carry on.
So, in order to be good of course, we're talking about how you see you, not what you're really like.
The low self-esteem on his body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem do less physical activity, eat fewer fruits and vegetables, participate in more diet than they can bring to a food mess.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people who are around them and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think that this is all about what they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diets -- aesthetic surgery, aesthetic sexual sexual sexual activity, and without protection and damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe in the way as you see.
Think of a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we were able to overcome this, what would that happen.
It would make this potential for each one of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking about itself, doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first is that we have to instill in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of programs have been able to do well without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program follow our children not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects of these are <unk> points for anyone willing to provide education in your body self-esteem that work.
A education is fundamental -- but facing this problem requires each of us to take the reins in the issue, and let's be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good for the contribution of our political <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people for what they are, not as you see.
And all of us can start doing this by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and comments we published on our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you -- when's the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow up to be valuing all their people, valuing the individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put the people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
So to make a difference in the real world, let's make them be them the ones that go out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never going to be aware of the people who are being seen, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who is on mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
<unk> A <unk>
It could be just the woman who is at two feet away. What would it mean for her if he was released from that voice <unk> in his interior, and he told him for not having a long legs.
What would it mean for her if we were going to do this, and we would call it for the potential that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images are <unk> to everybody.
But we will give our children the truth.
And so let's argue that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and because of what they do, and as they make us feel.
<unk> the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year of today, will become safe agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On the five November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense of Defense <unk>
At the beginning of initially what it was meant to, but being prisoner by other charges charges in the company of others, started planning to <unk> attacks about 12 of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N.
Luckily, those plans would be used by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't afford to.
Later on, it would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my dad.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, as he was an engineer named <unk> <unk> high school teacher -- between the two of them did all the possible for giving me a happy childhood.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims get to know.
And I saw that when people take time to interact and they don't need a lot to get the same stuff in life.
However, in all religion, in every human group, there's always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that they think that we have to use all of the possible media for everyone to live as them.
A few months before my arrest he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends, he and some friends, had been going to stop training on Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go to the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I played my father, my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder, and he explained to me how to aim at about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that <unk> gave the little orange light on the target and to surprise us, especially me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went to the rest and Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
Of course, a child, such child.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting it up with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot from the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times, that instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone already was time to pack and get to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class I was often a victim of <unk>
It was secret <unk> my identity to avoid the heart, but to be the new of the class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time was going on at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have social skills, to say it <unk> for growing <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I became an opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in proof of thinking was during the presidential presidential elections.
In a <unk> program that I was involved in the Amazon Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been victim of <unk> almost my whole life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who we had done, was Jewish people.
So I took a number of days out of the light, and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud to be able to beat the barrier that all life had made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush in the Bush <unk>
I found myself all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all the gay were bad <unk>
I happened to have the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critical ones I'd ever seen in life.
Having been a kid, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others. But it wasn't easy for me to treat people rather as I want to be treated.
And so I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is to be homosexual but I know what is being paid by something beyond my control.
Then he came up with the <unk> <unk>
Every evening, Jon Stewart made me be <unk> honest with my <unk> and I was helping to see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, don't have anything to do with character.
In many ways, he became my shape <unk> at a time where I was desperately <unk>
On occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> not in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something that preserving my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with a tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hatred inside your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decided to go out and put myself at a risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to bring violence, you can hear my story and understand that there's a better way, which even though I would join this violent ideology.
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, by the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has made in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism being talking against these meaningless acts as a rejection of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put myself here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or a race, that the children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
At this point there is a film that is projects in their minds.
It's an amazing film <unk>
It's in 3D, and it has sound <unk> of what you hear and you see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has bakery and tastes and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure -- your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that project to your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed in your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experiences all of us live.
This film is your <unk> the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an inner movie, you all have their own, you and you.
There's nothing going to be more directly.
At least I know I have a good awareness.
I don't have certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of our lives, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why are these films <unk>
Why are we not just the robots that are going to take up to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
<unk> for nature, is objective it.
<unk> for nature, is subjective <unk>
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the 20th century, we would take that vision.
The psychology was studying <unk> <unk> neuroscience is the <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientists about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything began to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time so that science is <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a budding of science of science about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limits to the moment.
The center of science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of fantastic work that presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain types of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you that this kind of work of neuroscience is answers some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what you do certain areas of the brain and what are it <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> to <unk>
There's actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the true central mystery of this <unk> Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is an internal <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk>
The typical <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors, how they operate the <unk> how they work <unk> how they are adapted and <unk> the living organisms -- all of these are questions about how the goal works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk about, how we speak, how we play <unk> all of these are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why it's all the behavior accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm paradigm of neuroscience, the standard paradigm of neuroscience, still doesn't have much to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I was hitting my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that will work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we were going to tell us at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful wonderful, great explanation. We get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains chemistry, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
For another, we don't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think the awareness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't know still how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> things before we could deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for these crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
And actually, what you need to do, is to explain the <unk> functions in the brain behaviors and so you study everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying for me.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as bricks and space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental properties and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of more basic terms.
On the contrary, they consider principles, and there are the world of the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space -- long, long, long, long, time, <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and applied the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those <unk> laws.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas of space, space, time, <unk> then <unk> then for logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be to make awareness of consciousness as a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not a matter of science anymore.
It opens up the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect awareness with other fundamental concepts -- the space, time, time, <unk> physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say we want to do fundamental laws that we can do it in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws that we can do it in a t-shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we're after.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all of you, every system is aware, not only humans, dogs, dogs, flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when he thinks "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of sense of feeling -- it would be some very crude precursor of consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think about something so <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental as space, time and dough is natural to assume that it can also be universal.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to be <unk> it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more of a continuum of nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws of finding fundamental laws that <unk> the thinking of the physical process, is to make consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information processing, there is awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human, complex awareness.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
Something really exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to be <unk> it has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an amazing degree of information integration -- a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a degree of information integration of information, as significant degree of consciousness -- quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration integration is rare, but it's not zero either.
In the <unk> theory, there's still a different awareness level from scratch.
In fact, <unk> a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate the consciousness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers often have observed that the physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies underneath.
Like Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire coming out of the <unk>
From the view of view, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the consciousness is that he puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out outside the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's out there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to address our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything to have consciousness, so I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think it tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a pretty serious ethical problems about the developing of the development of smart computers and the <unk> ethics system.
Finally, you can ask for the collective collective consciousness on the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group of integrated as the audience at a TED Talk, we have a TED collective consciousness -- an inner film for this whole group of TED, different from the internal films of each <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question you must have to be serious.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually sure the first crazy idea that consciousness is something fundamental than the second thing that is universal to be universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for the night in the morning.
But I think we're going to be able to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we only need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small village at Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a low part of education.
I went to school, I was fascinated with my friends, I would join my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a <unk>
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's an evident.
She doesn't really get anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school School, just after about 20 minutes in the classroom 11, and a guy raised her hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for about 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people at the wheelchair, they talk about <unk> things in school?"
<unk> in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people as inspiration objects.
And we don't are. And it's not the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, the disabled people are not our masters or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they were lied to disability.
Yes, it has been sold for the lie that disability is something <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with an disability that makes you love <unk>
It's not a bad thing and it doesn't make you <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more of this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the little girl without a little pen being held with a pencil held by mouth.
You may have seen a little kid who runs with <unk> fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the porn term <unk> because <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we will encourage the disabled people in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that I've been dealing with strange <unk> to say that they think I'm brave or a source of inspiration and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was blown away in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attached to people with disability in the benefit of people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't that bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually really difficult.
<unk> some things.
But the things that we do: they're not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
And I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was focusing on the so-called social model of disability, that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live because of our bodies or <unk>
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
It makes things that I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your ability as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies getting the best of their ability.
So, it's really fair to <unk> in the way we do, to share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, I don't do it.
And what you're thinking.
I'm here -- the inspiration, and you think, "My God, <unk> you're not going to be inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't realize that I am lucky, that them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to carry your mobile phone out into your car battery.
Great.
We learn from the strength and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that the lie that have been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that it's lie because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a stretch of stairs hasn't made it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> at a television screen won't come up with the <unk> for the <unk> people.
Nor did a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl, sitting in her room watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people who are supposed to be eaten by the bed and remember our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of the people with disability, and I want to live in a world where a child at 11 in a high school school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user <unk>
<unk> does not make us <unk> but question what you believe to know about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> reality and <unk> with <unk>
And what is the average velocity of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I just respond to one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I carry on. The Google <unk>
I'm sure a lot of people are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
They will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would do with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is running through the field of the game in the game of the game of the game to 160 blood beating the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds <unk> trying to match it all their self.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So I heard some videos to show you what is the Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, they are not images of the <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine up up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A few times a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk>
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about the feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be your favorite players, and they have asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which means many of you already know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no! I don't want <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a Russian roller coaster for his life.
What is the experience of a fan of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before running and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan.
When it can be <unk> running through the <unk> throwing the ball on the middle of the network?
What is your experience when you take a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> the augmented reality of augmented reality when <unk> and owners look at the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here is a brief clip about technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore were put on a <unk> to his <unk> in the field to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radii on the <unk> of the field <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, it was faster.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to your group, and you see your next thing to be shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on. You won't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or for memorize the strategy.
Just go into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, they hate <unk>
If you lose games <unk> as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual strategies <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game.
How do you do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera on every single corner of the stadium -- having a view from the top of the people that's down.
You also get information from the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all of that information, you send it to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
Bad people will have information <unk>
This is going to give the good teams of the bad equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being just <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk> it.
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
He <unk> the ball and <unk>
And they went to a wide open receptor. All of a sudden a <unk> on the left of your bombsight will tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> not the <unk> but the <unk> system will get you.
<unk> to the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open receptor.
<unk> the <unk> but you get it back.
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where we land, however, the receptor sees in your bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The <unk> <unk> and fans have followed by each angle.
This is something that will create massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to try and lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it just as a bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad your actions is from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it is being <unk>
How much is also worth a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, we face, as the time.
Thank you.
I recently told me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago I spent the end of the <unk> Lofa County <unk> which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who build the bridge bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from openness, over 1,600 people have jumped their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will bring them over to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, that every ever since he frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks into bone, some of which we have vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that don't normally get <unk> in the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the ones that are giving up this method of suicide will be aware of the death of the death of the death <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel on the bridge.
This is where most people have been in order to have their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at its darkest time, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year as this young man spoke with an official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had a successful day on her back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> the suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans officers train train to the new government people.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him about 22 of January, last year when they receive a call from a suicide bomber sitting on the <unk> about the center.
<unk> and when I arrived, he looked at Jason talking to the official Golden Gate Bridge <unk>
Jason got only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here two times before New Jersey to try to kill suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> asked us if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> you never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out with <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asking us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This guy and a smart guy in New Jersey had just been brought out of life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the following day, the mother rabbi was called me to see how he was.
The parents of Jason had asked it.
<unk> damage affects a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved <unk>
What about <unk>
What does it mean?
In my experience, it's not just to talk, but you need to hear.
Listening to understand.
You don't have <unk> or you tell the person who you know how it feels because they probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think someone is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end your life, you've had these <unk>
They were facing the person in front of the person in front of their life and to be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and you're never going to be able to do that, and believe that there is nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on January 19 of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with his permission and blessing I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> of 49 percent of his father in January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as disappeared as that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and told me that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> in the late day of the day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who has not been wrong with a real mental mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go to the road that his son took that day, and also the courage to go on.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote a radio call by a possible subject on the sidewalk near the north.
And I looked at my bike. I saw this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he immediately crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
And over the next time, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and <unk>
Kevin decided to find that day back on that lane and give it to life another opportunity.
When Kevin came up with it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked, "What was it that he made <unk> and gave the hope to the life and the other <unk>
And you know what told me?
He said, "Can you <unk>
You stopped talking and just <unk>
Soon after that incident, I got a letter from the mother, and I have that card with me, and I'd like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events of 11, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
<unk> Kevin when I was only six months old, completely unconscious from all of those traits -- but thank God, we all know it.
Kevin is in order, as the say.
We give God for you.
I really miss debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of her writing, <unk> <unk> When I visited General San Francisco at that night, you were <unk> as the patient.
<unk> I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and his depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I have found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather would become <unk>
That act, despite finishing their own pain, robbery the opportunity to meet me.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider the suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
Usually this is achieved only three things: the drugs or alcohol or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls of suicide around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved, only have lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
And over that time, I took my hand at three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and they can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said that the second to leave the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us must be used to be done.
<unk> can prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but you know what you are, and a question will tell you, how do you think about that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model model, I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever had as a child.
My outer end finally <unk> with my inner truth with my self.
For complicated reasons, the ones that I'm going over later, when I look at this photo, I'm thinking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm beginning.
We all get rid of our families, our religion, our society, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of skin or because of the beliefs of those around us.
They are people who always challenge the status quo -- which is considered to be <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
They signed up as <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines in my home, I always wore this shirt on the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why are you having this t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair -- I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> <unk> but now we know that, really, it is more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I never encouraged myself to share my story, not because I thought I'm going to be a bad thing, but how the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being female.
I've got mom, and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me: This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the CEO of a contest of beauty <unk>
And that night she asked me, "Why haven't you done in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if I <unk> she was taken away from the <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in a bathroom, he won in <unk> and he was a third <unk> between over 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first work was about queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when he <unk> to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that I was passed my head of the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me, and he said, "You know if you get to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I put two <unk> to my name.
She also told me when I was in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand to do the <unk> sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time in the U.S., it was necessary to do surgery before we changed the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means power or power to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears looked <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be a model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York City who was able to live his truth, but that <unk> put her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
Every 20 of November we do a global <unk> by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who <unk> and stood up to injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> for one day no longer <unk> of <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Do you do that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> first, thank you for all my <unk>
And to my support network, my parents especially, my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I attended young women who had been <unk> and sometimes when I was called me and they told me that their parents couldn't accept it, I took the phone, he called my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it works, sometimes it's not just <unk> identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table that sometimes a few times that assignment -- and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> And this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
I should have space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice, <unk> Thank you.
In many more and tribal societies, they are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> began his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when their efforts got to <unk> the <unk> National <unk> was made very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the story of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of the violence and the exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when when I was born, a girl, her birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome nor for his father, and for his mother.
The neighborhood comes, gives her <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot to have a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, the first daughter, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, he feels guilty as a criminal.
Not just clean mother, but the daughter.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it's home and the school admits of their siblings.
Until the age of 12 years, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it serves 13 years old, you prohibit her home without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of his house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and her brothers and her family, and if he <unk> the code of that honor, honor, that could even kill.
And it's interesting that this kind of code of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> it also affects the lives of male male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of their life and the happiness of their sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more norm of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and that accepts the decisions of their father and mother and <unk> decisions even if he doesn't want to.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with a old man, he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk> <unk>
If the <unk> very young, he has to accept it.
Otherwise, it <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson as her children are honored to.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe me, incredibly <unk>
And a lot before I had been thinking about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and he called my daughter to her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my feather, and I wrote a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she dies, when she was about four and a half and a half years old, I was <unk> in my school.
Can you ask, why should I mention a kid in a school?
Yeah, I must <unk>
They can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
One member of school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the form of <unk> Canada, and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was why the value of my daughter.
What my father could not give my sisters or their daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
And I would invite you to sit with me when my friends came to me.
<unk> to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to <unk> in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys in the way.
I used education to <unk>
I slept in my daughters, taught the students, to forget the lesson of the <unk>
He taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we met a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of the participation of women in all political, economic and social <unk>
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls were <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk for their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and got out of the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper by the BBC, blog that she was offered her for the New York Times, and I talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and the nine of October 2012, he was shot in his head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he would give up the ear of my wife -- "I've got to <unk> because of what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> he said, "Please, don't you <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right way and God <unk>
These little words are a lot for me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I grew up, I was in the hospital and I had severe headaches because his facial nerve was cut off. I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to <unk> "I'm okay with my <unk> smile with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to put it right. Please don't <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from it how to resist in the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when he doesn't end his task.
They fight their siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special in my <unk> that has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and <unk> and <unk>
I tell you, I'm not wondering what I did.
I don't know what I did.
I didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I have joined the Google <unk> <unk> where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that I'm going to talk about today about the science of brain, I did before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain surgery.
You are still as smart or not?
Is it not going to be like that, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
And then after the operation, I had to decide what a lot to take, over a dozen of our chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, they'll die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about all the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to get them to go with life.
More than once I have saved me.
But fortunately, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to try to get the <unk> dose, because there's not a clear map that tells you in <unk>
I started trying to test you with different mixes and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the <unk> dose, my sense of who I was me, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case, for a few months, I tried a typical dose and a typical chemical dose, and I was surprised by looking at how I knew my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I believed it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of the <unk>
It turned out as an end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> to fix a problem that I had on the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they have to do, since I am better for men.
What I was trying to do is that we can adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I think almost always in images, and that became my key point of key to how I can do with those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like that.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are the people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the brain works, and to me is simple: for most of us, the mental imagery are fundamental to <unk> and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I could find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> mental <unk> really <unk> sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use their imagination just to run the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There's incredible possibilities with this, as the way that people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty can do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were made by two groups that are done in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image by functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain. Here are the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of a person who looks at an image.
The middle of the middle shows the scan of that same individual self as you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left.
This <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image, and imagine that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into visual fields.
So let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos as they were <unk> their brains to create a big array of reactions in the brain in the computer sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new animals, and as long as they were <unk> a new <unk>
The computer -- using just the brain scan of the scanning <unk> to show what seemed that the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew up to us.
We're pretty close to doing it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you look at an image, and when you imagine that same picture, you create the brain the same <unk>
This led to the <unk> brain systems available today, and their resolution is increased to a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you <unk>
There are many techniques to do it.
One is opening the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't give me that one.
A lot of people are proposing new techniques of projection for images, even I am, we had to ask you with the recent result of MRI -- we need to ask ourselves the following, this technology will be the end of the way.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with larger, larger, but at this point, magnets <unk> only offer little improvements in resolution doesn't increase for thousands of them as we need.
I propose this idea, instead of the largest magnets make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in the MRI were to make really big magnets -- right?
However, most recent advances in the <unk> of clever and bright solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the ballot and radio receivers in the MRI system.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field -- even <unk> magnetic patterns <unk> into the radio frequencies of radio stations.
So when you combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of processing radio processing, we can increase massive form of information that can get in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide into layers our growing knowledge of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid fluid but the <unk> and the <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even direct neural activity is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas directly into the digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> use as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more options than opening up this door.
Anyway, take one year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
And I would probably say to some person for the first time that the love or telling someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have to go through in life.
All of these things is a hard conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and out of that way, is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through various stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> I gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be slope by the <unk> of my pants short, and I had <unk> my head and I would usually ask a kid to say, "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And he would quickly miss the table.
I got my jaw a little bit, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother launched.
But I would say anything, and I would go into it.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time I was ready and he was about to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues,"
So I took it deep down and I went down to my back a little girl with a pink dress, looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
So I took it back back again, and I got rid of <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, do I know this is true.
I have the short hair as a boy, and I saw a girl, but I'm a girl, and you know, you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more of the kind of girl from a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
You can give me a <unk> by <unk>
And that was all of it, just "Ah, OK. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the hard conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how one feels like a closet.
It's like my self is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I will give you a hundred reasons why to go out of my day it was harder than getting out of it, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who have declared banking bench is harder to say that it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is more difficult to tell your son of five years you're going to give you to <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop the things that are difficult for the other person that is difficult to make us feel better or worse in relation to our trade-off.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make sense of security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made -- it's not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse <unk> a dress and <unk> shoes.
It was not the militant lesbian prepared to fight any <unk> <unk>
I was frozen because I was born in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my <unk> said, and the move of a muscle is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole guys who I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world would turn back to purpose.
It was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't start that <unk> to kill.
One of my most memorable diapers was in my sister's wedding wedding party.
It was the first time that many people were invited to know that I was gay, and when I was doing my <unk> lady in my black dress, and I walked around the tables and I finally came around the tables and I finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew I was a few years old.
And after talking a moment, one of the women shouted, <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in St. Petersburg.
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program Will Will and Will <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but I hope to show desperately his support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is using shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, like all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize that they were <unk>
What else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
It's like the hard conversations still without being my strong point.
Ask anyone with the ones that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but you understand that what it involves coming out of is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others need to know that we do suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> simply <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, you know.
If they say their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will keep the hope that it could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some can be injured safe -- because they've done, but I never feel sorry for what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet I think, <unk> a <unk> you need to know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very alone, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of what intelligence has been seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical to the computer pioneers of the computer <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we took a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you are from a alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth or the Earth or the Earth or incredible lives, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which has no concept about intelligence on Earth, would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until some point in time, the asteroids that are <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet, stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that of understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to a number of years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately carefully for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that will increase the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to make complex tasks.
And so, by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked, I asked a number of years, and there's a mechanism underlying the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the nearest equivalent of an E and = <unk> for the intelligence that I have ever seen.
So what you're looking at here is a statement that intelligence is a force -- F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or maintain the open options with a magnetic force, with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yes, to an impending <unk> time.
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like being <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain the open.
And so, having into account this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the human <unk> level.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection is between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not just correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually it arises directly from her?
To find out, we developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy of entropy in any system where they meet in.
Amazingly, <unk> could be able to spend multiple animal tests -- play games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of that without the wrong thing to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He simply decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance have applications for <unk> robotics and human health technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a model version of that task.
This ability for cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see to <unk> orchestrate new connections into a social network where the friends are constantly getting together, and they are constantly keeping the net very well.
This same <unk> capacity of network also has applications in health care, energy care and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organizing the paths of a fleet of boats, and they will find it successfully and using the Panama Panama to extend their scope from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in <unk> and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of Cambridge negotiation by increasing assets under their exponentially.
This risk management ability to have vast applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of <unk> cognitive behavior such as using tools, walk upright and social cooperation, all derived from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term of the term -- the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if we were <unk> smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would have been <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion, dominated by reverse.
It's not that machines are becoming smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take control of all of the future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of general intelligence can actually arise out of control, rather than being the other way around.
Another important implication is the pursuit of the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets are going into this kind of <unk>
So my statement to that statement to go through the descendants to help them build artificial artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: The intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of potential planets that orbit of other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the faint intensity of stars when planets go ahead of them, and they recorded a little bit of that light that you go.
The data collected by Kepler shows the sizes of the planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their stem star.
Together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets from our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their own.
At its time, this is clues about whether these planets that we find are livable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds that are potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale has rapidly <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I am not a weather scientist, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone really interested in the search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more I look for planets like Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world demonstrated that for a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and part of it, that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track their surface for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission, they take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies are now offered not just short space flights but also <unk> to live on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked to our imagination with the ideas that are linked to the ideas that are linked to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live in.
Let's take the expansion of <unk> areas of our planet that still remain <unk> places that are really going to be matched with Mars.
Even in the <unk> and higher places on Earth the air is cool and filled with oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests at thousands of miles away.
I'm worried that this excitement from the colonization of Mars and other planets going to get a big and sad <unk> and the belief and the belief that Mars is waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly global, the Earth.
For a lot that I like to like to like exploration -- I'm deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars is going to be there to <unk> humanity is like imagine the captain of the Titanic to tell us that the party really will have place later in the life <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for competitive exploration and international preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They are only closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces, in the hostile and <unk> zones of the ground, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi finally asked her, and we realized that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough advanced enough to consider to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of how important to protect the origin of the planets that are going to develop this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization of us will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to adapt to the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own house.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the dining table, where I had <unk> them.
So quickly tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all very closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back to my friend of Jeff to go through the night because I had a flight early in Europe at the next morning, and I <unk> from my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but surely that no more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I was really over.
I'm a profession, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases the heart rate -- you will get the adrenaline levels and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the counter <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something that could be done, systems that could put in place, which is that they were going to be doing bad things.
Or at least if you look at bad things, that <unk> the chance that it's a total <unk>
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts were not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who was the Nobel Prize, and a little bit embarrassed I told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me I'd been practicing something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written out of a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everyone knows what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and trying to figure out what went wrong, okay?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try and figure out all the things that you could go out wrong, then it tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things out of it or to minimize the harm.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the shape of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with obvious.
In the house, it <unk> a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds like common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to address the location of the important things, where the fine, where the fish are, where the fish, places where the tribes live and friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find stuff.
But it's really good for things that don't move very much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car, check and <unk>
So at home, you know, a place for keys, a hook along the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular empire.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it all your things always will be out there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take your credit cards -- a picture of your credit cards stopped from driving your head to the mail to yourself so you're in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> it can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases your your brain out.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that low stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there are perhaps more stressful than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or one to be dear to help with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is happening as a <unk> for all of them making medical decisions, and in fact for the decision-making of financial decisions and social decisions -- any kind of decision that we need to take from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little <unk>
Everyone knows that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even you may have to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> the <unk>
But there is a question you must do then, a statistic that is supposed to ask for the majority of people who don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or having surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And you must think of what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
Number one must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I couldn't help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a doctor, and if it's somebody's guilt about scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well <unk>
But <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before you help someone help somebody help you.
300.
And this is according to the research of the cynical researchers <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, or another <unk> event.
Now you may think, "Well, one chance in 300 to <unk> my <unk>
Why no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistical statistic -- and it is, <unk> of the <unk> effects, right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> muscle pain.
But a moment.
Remember that under stress you don't think clearly.
So think about how to do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking about the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has been <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out <unk> for the drug of your drug to help you the drug.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with your physician.
The medical ethics does it is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take your risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat it is quite typical.
For the surgery that is more done in men that is done in the older men in the prostate cancer, the number necessary to try is <unk>
This is, 49 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case is produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only <unk> one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue that we will bring the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this in the act.
And they also want to think of the quality of life.
Because you have a choice too many times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change the opinion of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> <unk> with a predator, you don't need the immune system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get the lunch for the lions, so none of that matter.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the <unk> rational thought, as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to think about the future in this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a while.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> are going to be able to put systems into the place that will help minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> on the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a <unk> of combination along the door, with a key to the gate in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be -- I would never have a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, the <unk> besides a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the decade in 1800, and at the time of the time, it mixed with local signs, and developed the language we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I now realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, and they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world is as if I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms of <unk>
So how do the sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people answers.
So I've learned for example for example.
<unk> <unk>
Don't do a lot of noise from eating the bag of chips <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, you don't get the <unk> <unk>
This is all I call <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of sounds.
And I'm always waiting for the sound of sound, what is going to be next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
<unk> for moving on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines contain sounds across the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In the <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me to do this with my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I have four lines in the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
It's going to be <unk> more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property of sound and <unk> in my education practice.
And all I had taught me in terms of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new job of work.
And when I introduced it to the arts community, he was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> was something of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could <unk>
I chose to get <unk>
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me and become my voice.
That way I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, I work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking <unk> his voices, I am able to maintain a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I will not continue with this practice, I feel like I could get it into the <unk> and you don't have any kind of social value.
So, with sound like my new artistic medium <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can not capture and express the paper.
And the same thing can be called a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning in the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor of the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in many different parameters, and different <unk>
If it's <unk> a different <unk> for every finger while it touches the piano, as the facial expression, the body movement, the speed, the shape of the hand and so as the piano, the English is a linear language -- as if it <unk> only one key at once.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a concept of concept or idea in <unk>
If I just would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with the music in terms of tone <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal is <unk> in that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the glasses of the music?
If I had to create a sign and then you put it over and again, it could become a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of <unk> the sun comes out and you watch.
This is all day."
If you look at it, and you roll it down, the visually speed, looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be called <unk> <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  <unk> the <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how the time is expressed in <unk> and how distance to the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> one again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> the same time."
You see <unk> hand, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of them with the hands up.
Now we're going to do it as much in your head as the chest of something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please do it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
So look at how three signs are very similar. They all occur in the head and the chest but they carry very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and concentrated as the music.
However, today, we live in a very small world.
And only because the <unk> doesn't automatically have a social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe the people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn how to learn, and you don't have to hear to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich trove of trove and I'd like to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You know, you would make it all, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because adults lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I became older, I found out that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning the other ones from others.
The time country, now I'm an adult and I teach citizenship and invention in <unk> Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of garbage.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and not, it's not drinking alcohol, and if you are, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big <unk> and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very <unk> to use those huge lights.
So together with my students, six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> of work with <unk> so that the very <unk> kids can also come in.
And I will tell you the kids who manipulate electrical tools are great, and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and reduce it to the size that we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave you to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure out what we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would get a lot with the robots.
And then we created very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in the creation of prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we turn into light and web cameras in return, and we would put it into a floating robot that will move through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board will process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I was able to take this invention to step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else gets rid of it.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and they're trying to be trying to fix it immediately.
I'm able to investigate my problem with <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very good children.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and you get bored with this one.
A child, perhaps less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> of the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that water is brown, the mud and the oil is also brown color and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what there is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we built a first prototype of a <unk> that can lead through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what there is in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was able to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a harder problem, and also more close to me.
I'm half a French half and probably remember, in 2011, there was an devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that we started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima, nuclear power to the water.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons still are leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast and most of the time, and the most moment, it has safe is blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to <unk> every year from the crash and research in a form of an independent way with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course, not <unk> parents don't <unk>
But every night we <unk> at the center of <unk> here you see the use of <unk>
It might seem like they didn't take work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discussed the <unk> data that day and we talked about what we were going to do next, the strategies, and so on.
And to do this, we create a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive dust <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
Was it a <unk> <unk>
But based on this organized civil expedition -- the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We are approaching the way to 1.5 miles of nuclear model, and with the fishermen help of the area we were collecting sediments of the sea floor with a <unk> device as we invented and we've built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a remote problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been really exciting to work on these different scales -- also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became so much so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we converted it into the largest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood metal -- chemistry, a little bit of biology, <unk> can be built almost from all there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can become reality with the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with energy energy.
For example.
Or can we help in the mobility of the advanced age transforming their standard <unk> chairs in new <unk>
<unk> and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, scientists, creators, we need to prepare the next generation to care about the environment and people, and so I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of steel pieces of steel -- the other one of a <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic <unk>
One is imposes on the environment, the other thing imagined it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Miguel <unk> said that when he looked at the <unk> in gross, he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
The <unk> was only by Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, cells, we carry all the information required for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> and production of mass production.
The lines of <unk> have dictated a world done from parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think their objects like <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> of <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One is actually acting mainly like filter the other mainly as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually through the variation of <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect in working with the <unk> and the gene between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the <unk> analysis, is shown in the two screens behind me.
My work, at the most simple level, tries to bridge these two visions of the world, from assembly and go to growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why wasn't it possible for this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special time in history, a weird moment, where they connect four disciplines that offers access to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, and products, structures and tools through large-scale scales, such as this robotic arm with a sense of 24 feet in diameter with a means of <unk> <unk> and graphics to the nanoscale made of genetically <unk> <unk> that glow in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of ancient architecture, Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where every opening is only to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion fashion with <unk> van <unk> It's like a second skin made of one piece, <unk> in the <unk> flexible around the waist.
Along with a 3D printing collaborator -- we printed this layer and <unk> 3D layer, and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet <unk> <unk> and <unk> materials in the <unk> <unk>
This is the resolution of human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> machine.
That designers have access to this high resolution <unk> and the <unk> instruments that allow us to design products that are <unk> not only the way our bodies, but also physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair, a <unk> <unk> and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter teacher -- my collaborator, went back to nature to <unk> and to design this pattern of <unk> surface it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 properties -- which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
His surface, as in nature, stick its functionality not by addition to the addition of another material or another <unk> but <unk> and <unk> the material property.
But it's <unk> nature.
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them became and really got to define a lot of what matters to me.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God send the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> tree.
So for that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between <unk> branches, <unk> and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of <unk>
Instead, the Earth was growing trees with branches, <unk> <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made out of place.
I often wonder, "What would the design would be if the objects were made of one part?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we look at the <unk> material, the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons that are produced every year by shrimp, or or like <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
We thought that if we could <unk> their properties, we could generate <unk> structures on one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  We asked a bunch of husks of <unk> the <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to get a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of a single <unk> material, 100 percent recyclable
When the pieces are ready, you will dry it up to find a natural way to the contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a <unk> of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> <unk> that showed for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, and the bacteria have genetically engineered bacteria to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition from the <unk> problems to mesh, and if it was even more on the window.
A little bit of a piece of <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first life forms on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure of <unk> of shrimp <unk> into an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best two: for objects designed to <unk> in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, they'll grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration is the solar system as the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for the <unk>
To do that, we need to dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So the <unk> board, we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new aspects of biological channels inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these invisible <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, they were <unk> two microorganisms.
The first one is <unk>
He lives in our oceans and on the walls of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
It turns the light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
It's never been <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship to a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the tract tract -- that will help us to make these bacteria and that they will make their function of path.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to the functionality to it.
If we wanted more <unk> they had more transparent channels.
This organic system <unk> when it stretches from one end to another, it goes 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football, and 10 times more than our intestine thin.
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside your clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> <unk> only half is <unk>
What if the design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the matter alive?
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin -- we would have human tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a kind of editing that biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer printing material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't make it like that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home inside which is <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is not about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts like structure, the other is the glue or matrix, put those fibers in between the other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a tension structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm into a flat environment, not within a box, we realized that you would have a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts of all of us, different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
They often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> its silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we could shape <unk> silk without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we formed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, and we put ourselves into our site.
We knew we knew that silk worms are going to be more dark and darker and <unk> so we use a solar path to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat by distributed silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get <unk>
We asked <unk> worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as <unk> <unk> were <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
<unk> biological silk about silk <unk> <unk> give all this <unk>
And in a little more than two or three weeks, we <unk> silk worms <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> by a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to provide life to the products and the buildings that around us, to form a ecology of two materials -- designers must bring these two visions of the world.
What drives us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new age of creation, which leads to a design inspired by nature inspired by the design, which requires us, for the first time, that we do in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time this?
They can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English and the <unk> and the art and he went on, and then he was playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, for having dedicated time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to give it out.
But then I'm going to tell you about something else, something totally different, and I'm going to get involved in it, and I'm going to feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it on.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all of my other passions and <unk> <unk>
Another reason that I made so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong about this, and something wrong with me for nothing.
I was worried about commitment, or <unk> or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to have raised me then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they did, they learned from culture.
And we asked ourselves, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were saying to that age.
It's considered a naive question to provoke cute answers in children like, <unk> or <unk> <unk> or I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question gets us over and over again, as you grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students ask you to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's about being the cute exercise of before what the sleep takes off.
Why?
If this matter is inspired by children to dream with what might be, is not inspired by dreaming of what they might be.
In fact, it does just do the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, although adults are probably <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine converted into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative design.
But most of the kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it is more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something that is going on for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up with curiosity and many different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone in that framework.
And so you can feel it.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And you feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with lots of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so say.
Could it help if you divide into three parts: multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that you would get the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the Renaissance, the ideal was the one who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
Do you make any term you like it or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or woe you must win.
But what I've learned from talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields, and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interests shared on cartography, visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this single idea for his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
From there comes the new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is very quickly.
When we get them into something, we are going to do it.
We look at all that we can have in our hands.
We are used to being <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means we are less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and a independent author of independent.
As a child, he would give an amazing capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it become a writer, <unk> was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when they were starting their <unk> and this ability to help you write a lot for the editors.
It's rarely a loss of time to get to what you're going to get to, even if you end up with it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other website, sometimes a result of Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their customers.
<unk> Company defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that are able to be able to meet the market needs, the ones that are actually <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging the <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> out of the belly knowing why they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive down deep and put in ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge in the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to address how we are connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in a large part of them will be told to be more like their fellow <unk>
Once you said this, if there's one thing that you will take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with internal biases -- whatever it is.
If you're a heart specialist then, you would go through all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those that you just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I said, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep a curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner biases leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year they went to a woman named <unk> they took them to a psychiatric clinic.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until that, unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, he was doing a <unk> and they found strange plates and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If we had been living today, we could not give her to her more help than he was <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in receiving a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's.
Since <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it's little more progress in the treatment of Alzheimer's.
I am part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, will include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the chance of Alzheimer's will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the probability that they spend their years or Alzheimer's years or helping care of a friend or to be dear Alzheimer's.
In the U.S., it's about 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease, and their costs of <unk> increase in five times in 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it has been a relatively little kind of <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that can't be <unk> cure or even slow down their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we have invested less time and money in the research of it.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer cancer research in Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a <unk> percent of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is because of a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what people knows, but all the world's <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of the years -- even the scientists, for Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a photo of a healthy brain that compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical harm caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger severe memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduces the life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made out of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that becomes a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these points <unk> end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are left on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of what step on, block is complex, as a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that you did, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, they have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, and physical chemicals, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process -- now it's testing a new kind of drugs that we recorded specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick to each other within them, as humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live in a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to grow that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince ourselves that Alzheimer's is a disease and if we can do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have taken more research and <unk> pressure on governments, the pharmaceutical industry and <unk>
That was essential to advance HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I had this article in the New York Times, in January Times, in January of this year.
To love someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and in my own experience when I test it as a night of last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are <unk> to get 36 questions, and then you both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number one: When was the last time you had to ask someone else to <unk>
And <unk>
And so they <unk> these are getting more personal and more.
Number one: <unk> really bothers me, <unk> your partner what you like to or her, and it really honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I came up with this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me -- the gadget two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the time to test this study, someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
But I thought that it was a good story, so I send it to the spine of the families -- it's a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's <unk> so I guess some of you are probably asking yourself, they still go together.
And the reason I think that question this is because they have done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
One week before the article was <unk> I was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had told me to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entrance can get to a few hundred views -- and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my paper in the New York Times would have probably a few thousand views.
And that found a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
So the article was published on a Friday night, and I was on Saturday, and this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, they had called "Today Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got more than eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with each other, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been an international news -- and that the people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or wrote what they did every day for weeks, they were always doing the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the <unk> of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
They even gave a talk, and a woman yelled at the stage, "Hey, <unk> where your <unk> is.
And I immediately put red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship on a international journal you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for St. <unk> that included the experiences of readers to test the study on them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews and <unk> orders from us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons of <unk> of the process of <unk> a range of which I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked work, they wanted to know if it really was able to produce <unk> <unk> not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially the wrong question.
How do you know if you put together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, it would make the experience of doing these 36 questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the research goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for interpersonal improvisation -- between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were felt closer after doing that, several later studies were also used by <unk> protocol <unk> as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they have used it between people of other opposite <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was <unk> in this paper, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little university arts university, and then a student came up to me and he told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed to be <unk> by it.
And I was like, you want to say that you would fall away from the person with whom you will.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they did get better better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came up with the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really hard <unk>
I'd had that relationship since I had 20, what was supposed to practically all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I went to the science.
And I was doing everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could be a certain form of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I was only going to work for the book that I wrote for but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad, and I used to be then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly -- and I can realize that what I'm looking for, is sometimes more than reasonably far as reasonably for me.
What I'm looking for about love is an assurance -- not only to be <unk> today, and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to remain <unk> by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story told the media about the 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way in order to mitigate something of the <unk> risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because fall in love makes us feel <unk> but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that question: still follow together?
And the content with a response is or No.
So more than a question, you know that let's make more hard questions, questions like, "How do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How are you going to stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to one relationship?
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love to love somebody.
So, if you want the brief version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known year, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still follow together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing that will remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
<unk> fallen in love because we took the power election.
And I shudder to read it a little bit at the reading now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, there was no idea what that choice was.
I didn't think I would have both of them to make that decision, and how much times will I have to keep doing that choice without knowing before if he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded by 36 questions, having chosen to love someone so generous, and kind of fun and expressed that choice on the largest largest newspaper in the U.S.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't think about.
And what they did, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love somebody, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by <unk> lesbian in a certain mountain, and I became like a forest <unk>
It's a time --  -- something that really affected me but more detail later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
So I took a box of wood, and we took a bill for a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a time I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from <unk> and <unk> and all of those things, and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> in the style of Agnes Martin, the covered of resin and a bee got <unk>
Well, my mother has a fear of bees, and it's <unk> to them, so I added a lot of resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, it happened in the opposite: somehow it seemed that growing the size of the size of the text with a <unk>
So I did, I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add some electronic elements, we would find strange bottles that I was finding on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realize that God can draw in space.
I can flow up with it -- drawing just like a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of individuals who were <unk>
First of all, I think you can get an idea.
Then I made some insects and strange creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings in layers.
It was great, except for one thing: <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing in the glass layers -- similar to the drawing in a window in a window in another window, and another window, and it had all these windows together that fit a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my <unk> work with something very big, that I call <unk>
For <unk> I was inspired by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double a face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals with animals are travel between two worlds.
They go from <unk> to this <unk> of <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are heading to the <unk> lists to suicide in mass <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a male god tied up to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the shelter of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
But anyway, a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in one hand while the other hand comes out.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of <unk>
It's a little story.
So that's the hand that we <unk>
And then when you go on the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird rate, and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn on a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that come up, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> balloon made of terrorist cards.
They have <unk> them.
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries.
But each one of them acts as a kind of archive in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They are like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting a few years.
Each one is basically a pack of microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds of a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> the chest is <unk> the <unk>
I'm going to join you with the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of his chest, and it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see it.
This is a body party in half.
This is two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There's a few pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue of this strange statue there.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a musician, a writer, an <unk> a <unk> a <unk> an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
It takes the box and all of the people inside hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we come to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of religion, is not working.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to swap those things with <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so this pill has effect against pain, first happens by the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
So I'll take a pill. It is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug will impact on the body.
The <unk> however, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take <unk> drugs that are <unk> to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart of cells.
But they are also known for their side effects <unk> in most negative because in time it takes to reach the blood stream and get worse and worse than the time it takes to get to the destination, which is where it's more important, in the HIV <unk>
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't go easily in the bloodstream of the patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new stem cells.
This is the great issue of HIV treatment with current drugs that is a treatment of life managed by <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, <unk> to make the treatment directly to the <unk> of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for care of wounds and care of diabetes, they can be used for anything else -- including the drug <unk> of drugs.
In fact, we're already using <unk> <unk> to open or <unk> extremely small holes that open and closing almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best you ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit of laser beam a laser beam about HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of China?
Before you even know it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a device from three head.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is going to go to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases directly in the site of infection, as the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't look a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all the research researcher of <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I have studied armed groups -- not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not shooting at them.
And my goal is to understand better to better understand these policy agents of violence and study ways of encouraging violent participation from violent participation to violent <unk>
I do <unk> in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, the <unk> peacekeeping deals with 1975 and 2011, <unk> were signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we have to be able to engage or engage in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and policies are not <unk>
Everything is part of the same organization.
We cannot understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
Since their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs <unk> from Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking again.
<unk> a complex machine of communication stations from radio stations and radio stations and media websites and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the journal <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
armed groups are also investing in a complex tax capital of <unk> but through <unk> business for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funding, to build better and build their brand.
They also do something else, they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, running schools, put in a professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population offering something that the state doesn't make security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan ripped away by the war or even the <unk> of <unk> can also be able to figure out the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 from 2006 from Palestinian Hamas cannot be able to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps <unk> by government, and they emerge as armed and political groups, they participate in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated the sophisticated organizations are all of those organizations, we can be <unk> as something else to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory that they run all of your <unk> collect the trash, run the <unk>
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of states, without state and hybrids and the weakest of them are states, as in the Middle East, more <unk> and they fill that gap the non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in no military tools.
We have that vacuum of governance has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important also to set up and strengthen peace.
If we understand better groups -- we understand better what incentives offer to foster violence from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, and we don't have the military power can win some <unk> but we're not giving us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security vacuum to fill that vacuum of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a start.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My views on gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid they accept openly <unk> it would be unfair for <unk>
I am <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I'm going to tell me as a bad feminist.
Or at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then on interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women who are <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> of sex.
Today, I see how women treat women around the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> that could be a feminist.
Being labeled as feminist was a <unk> a taboo word and nasty.
I was reminded as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and he can't imagine being another person.
With the time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, as <unk> and besides, proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They were doing the same pay for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use easy and accessible to the contraceptives and <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need for <unk> controls, or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to have in mind our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition and so much more.
We need to have to realize these differences and how we behave in the same way that it matters in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I listen to rap music, by listening to all volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and makes me deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> in the yin -- yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> reality with your <unk> shirt with you.
<unk> <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical self.
I believe firmly in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk>  all of the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, a collection of trash, and <unk> and maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
<unk> is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> stories that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, is her choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides a woman to stay home to raise his children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable to this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> in a way that makes women be economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color, and gay <unk> and gay women and <unk> and white, <unk> and high class <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist feminism one.
It also happens the following: As <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
Do we have this tendency to put psychologists <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that it will be perfection.
When we were <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I know that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid of standing up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> for fear of what it means for fear of not being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get realistic expectations.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it <unk>
The last few years is a <unk> feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> in 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show up to this pop star embracing feminism and to know women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started debates endless debates if they were <unk> it was or no feminist.
<unk> your feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection as we are still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we want a lot, we need so much.
We're going to go so much beyond reasonable <unk> and <unk> to get rid of the feminism of any woman's feminism until it's not left.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our own <unk> to the action and being a little more <unk>
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists who would be more happy to provide a food supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until we <unk> the change affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does their music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when bad decisions justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
They are two and bright girls and brilliant, and also very brave. I want to grow up in a world.
And they were given to the strong creatures that they are.
And I think of them, all of a sudden the best option will be <unk> like something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel where a television program is treating sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio signal, when we heard women treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money in order to go to cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes treat their peers as <unk>
In any case, men, especially men white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in your journal to participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough for women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we were encouraging to participate in this kind of projects, we can also afford to be even more than more of us as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision tests.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions will get to the top, people in the power of directors and movie and music, <unk> the <unk> the people that can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a lasting durable and significant.
We can also say with courage our robots -- well, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, most of all, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few guys asked me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after I didn't get me to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have a brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also discovered that if I was a little brave one, another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell you that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I have a <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good feminist, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can do the same thing.
I hope we could all be a little courageous, when you need such <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> because I went to <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border.
One of the <unk> things from this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with a immune immune system is one of the most <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak -- they had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to be supposed to be <unk> autism.
But a moment, it wasn't the article that unleashed the controversial story about autism and vaccines <unk> disqualified and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical School.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children of autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism the rise of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians that I had heard about it creating their entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence followed only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the '90s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of funds as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could make another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control to what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic -- and "A better detection detection to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks to the face of his son of the <unk>
If the criteria of diagnosis had to be <unk> why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is what happened to be slow and slow progress from the science to the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten at the dark corner of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> who looked like a paper that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds <unk> to the people around her them, even their own parents.
They could be fun for hours I was waving by the hands of their faces, but they were prey out of panic by <unk> as when they were not placed their favorite toy in its usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as a major authority of the world in the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 real cases of their syndrome as far as we were <unk> from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of autism for diagnosing autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give you that diagnosis to children with seizures yet, but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had turned to nine of every 10 children in their doctor's office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of heart disease caused by cold, cold parents.
These kids, he said, they have kept it very carefully on a refrigerator than not <unk>
At the same time, however, <unk> noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the children in their clinic could tell you between 18 <unk> before I turned two years old.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like the children were just simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, the researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> the cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers in <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as a little bit like <unk> without special education, no special access to other resources without any diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service, they needed more resources for the autistic children, and their families <unk> and their colleague Judith <unk> decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse in trouble.
Some children couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or <unk>
In another way, these children didn't fit into <unk> and <unk> as he said, <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody ever realized these children before?
But then <unk> found a reference to a paper published published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then it was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but I avoided a <unk> <unk> in their own work.
There was not even a translation to the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he would do it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
Her author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinic integrated with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for children's teaching differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with a computer exercises with music, and the children kept their games on Sunday.
Instead of blaming the parents of autism, Asperger's described it as disabled disabled disabled forms that required forms of support and <unk> spaces adapted during the course of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, <unk> called them their little teachers, and he started to help the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
<unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of Lebanese and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they have always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> <unk> in the pop culture like awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked at silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes arrived in <unk> by the limited model of <unk> by a wide and inclusive.
These changes didn't belong in a broken shot.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked with each other to reform these <unk> people around the world see an individual adult for the first time.
Before I came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and parents around the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a <unk> <unk> a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnostics started <unk> as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that it was, what the people with autism and their families finally will support the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame the vaccines for the rise of the <unk> and a powerful, powerful, <unk> story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the heart center that one in 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined on the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles for solving the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
A way of understanding <unk> is to think of terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC operates doesn't mean the Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> <unk> and suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
Certainly the autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> who believed that the <unk> for the most autism aspects of autism are found in understanding the teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and the parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we move into a uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence forms on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
